TITLE		Save properties

OCCURRENCE	In 'Properties' menus

DESCRIPTION	Saves the userdefined setup (colours, fonts, ...) to files
		'~/.arb_prop/*' located in the users home directory.

NOTES		To reset ARB to it's defaults simply remove one/all *.arb
		files from the directory '~/.arb_prop'

		The files in ~/.arb_prop are textfiles. Advanced users may
		remove or change single sections or entries.

		You can hand over your properties to another user by giving him
		your property-files.

SECTION GENERAL NOTES ABOUT PROPERTIES

    Most settings you can change in ARB are saved either

          - to properties or
          - with your database.

    Nevertheless some setting are not stored anywhere (some intentionally, some by mistake).

    Please notify LINK{arb@arb-home.de} if you think

      - a setting should be saved in properties (instead of always setting
        the same useless default value)
      - a setting should be saved in the database instead of properties (or
        vice versa)

EXAMPLES	None

WARNINGS	Better make backups of these files before you change them.

                Be careful with ARB_MERGE: It uses the same properties as ARB_NT!

BUGS		No bugs known
