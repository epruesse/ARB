TITLE		Visualization of Three-dimensional structure of small subunit (16S) rRNA


OCCURRENCE	In Primary Sequnce Editor (ARB_EDIT4)

DESCRIPTION  

    This program (RNA3D) displays the three-dimensional structure of small subunit (16S)
    rRNA in OpenGL 3D environment. The annotation of RNA three-dimensional structures
    consists of a preprocessing of the information embedded in their 3D coordinates. It
    processes PDB structural information stored in the PDB file (1M5G) and used for
    further structural analysis and searches. To provide user with the more detatiled
    perspective of 16S rRNA structure, structural information corresponding to the
    ribosmal protiens were excluded during processing. The extracted structural informaion
    is then fed to OpenGL engine, where it is further transformed into a hierarchy of
    OpenGL objects, which encode molecule chains, residues and base positions. At this
    stage, further processing may occur, for example when the user requests the mapping of
    secondary structure information of rRNA onto the molecule in the form of loops and
    stems. Any information derived from the multiple alignments (phylogenetic information)
    is merged into the structural information or rRNA molecule in the post-processing
    step.
    
NOTES

    More information regarding merging secondary structure infomation and mapping
    individual rRNA sequence,sequence associated data, oligonucleotide probes can be found
    in the respective help files. See "Subtopics" section.
