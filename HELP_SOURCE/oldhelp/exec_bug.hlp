TITLE		How to fix an 'exec' problem ?

OCCURRENCE	NDS + ACI 	exec - command

DESCRIPTION	If you use the exec command in the NDS window then
		you might have to wait extremely long:
			number of species *
			execution time of the command
			(5000 species, 1.5 sec/exec) -> 2 hour waiting.

SECTION         WHAT TO DO

		The only way the to remove the exec command is:
		run arb_panic on any shell
		save the database to /tmp/panic.arb
		edit /tmp/panic.arb
		search the exec command
		replace it by the 'echo' command
		save file
		test it with 'arb /tmp/panic.arb'
		If everything works fine save it in your home directory
		enter 'arb_clean' on any shell
		remove /tmp/panic.arb

WARNINGS	Test your database very carefully because it may not be
		consistent.
		Check sequence checksum

BUGS		No bugs known
