TITLE		Calculate the Percentage of the Most Frequent Base

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/SAI/create SAI/Max Frequency

DESCRIPTION	Finds the most frequent base in each column for all marked
		species. Than the number of all sequences with this base are
		divided by:
			a: the number of all marked sequences, if not ignoring gaps
			b: the number of bases in this column, if ignoring gaps
		The resulting percentage is divided by ten and the second last
		digit taken:

			0%  - 25% will never occur
			25% - 29% -> '2'
			30% - 39% -> '3'
			...
			90% - 99% -> '9'
			100%	  -> '0'


NOTE		The result can be used as a conservation profile and filter:
		W.L.'s rule:
		The higher the number the more conserved the position.

EXAMPLES	Say one column contains 7 A's 4 G's and 5 Gaps.
		Ignoring Gaps will result in 7/11 == 64 %
		which is converted to '6'.
		Otherwise we get 7/16 == 44% which will be indicated by a
		'4' in the target sequence.

NOTE		'-' @#@ are regarded as gaps.
		'.' are always ignored.
