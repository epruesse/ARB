SECTION         What do we mean if we talk about ...

        ALIGNMENT

                        Subdatabase containing homologous sequences (different
        		'alignments' can be stored along with the species information)

        ACI

                        ARB Command Interpreter. ACI is a simple programing language
        		for calculating special species information (eg. G+C Content..)

        EDGE

                        Branch within a tree defined by nodes

        FIELD

                        Container for 'species' associated information

        MARKED SPECIES

                        Marking of 'species' defines the datasubset which is analyzed
                        by the ARB tools.

        NAMES

                        Identifier for 'species' entries. Can be automatically generated

        NDS

                        Node Display Setup: defines informatio which is displayed at
        		tree nodes.

        NODE

                        Internal: connects branches of a tree
        		Terminal: free end of branches representing 'species'

        PT_SERVER

                        Server using a special form of the ARB database for rapid
        		similarity searching (automated alignment, probe design/check)

        SAI

                        Sequence Associated Information

        SELECTED SPECIES

                        'species' highlighted (selected) using the 'ARB_NT/Species/
                        Search' or 'ARB_INTRO <MERGE TWO ARB DATABASES> tools.

        SPECIES

                        Database entry containing a sequence and associated information.
        		Not necessarily consistent with a taxonomic species

        SRT

                        Search and Replace Tool allows to search substrings in a string
        		and replace them by another substring.
