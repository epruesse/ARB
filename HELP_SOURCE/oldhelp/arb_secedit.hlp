TITLE		ARB_SECEDIT - Secondary structure editor

OCCURRENCE	ARB_EDIT4/Edit/Edit secondary structure

DESCRIPTION	ARB_SECEDIT is designed to maintain the structure and layout
		information of secondary structures [ARB only supports ONE
		secondary structure per database].

		ARB_SECEDIT always displays the data of the species currently
		selected in ARB_EDIT4.

NOTES		If you start ARB_SECEDIT the first time (for the current
		database), you'll see a structure formed like a big bone.
		This is the default structure and after you've created a valid
		helix you should delete the default helix (because it's
		futile, but there always has to be at least one helix).

EXAMPLES	None

WARNINGS	None

BUGS		No bugs known
