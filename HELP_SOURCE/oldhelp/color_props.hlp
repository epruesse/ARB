DESCRIPTION     This is a generic window that allows you to configure
                the display colors of the current application.

                Click onto the colorized button to open a color selection window.
                That window contains some predefined colors and the possibility to
                change red/green/blue values of the current color.

                Next to the colorized buttons there are textfields containing the
                color values. There are three different types of values:

                      - color names (like 'red', 'green', ..)
                      - '#rgb' where r/g/b stands for 0..f (hexadecimal values)
                      - '#rrggbb' same as above

                Attached to some of the colors there are font definitions, where you
                may select the font type and size.

                This window may contain a button at the bottom, allowing you to define the
                colors of color groups (see LINK{color_props_groups.hlp}).

NOTES		See 'xcolors' for color names.

EXAMPLES	When called from ARB_NT, this window allows to define colours and fonts
                for the tree display area.

                    Different colours and fonts can be used to indicate marked and
                    unmarked species as well as branches or groups containing
                    marked and unmarked species.

                When called from ARB_EDIT4, this window allows to define colours and fonts
                for the sequence display area.

WARNINGS	None

BUGS		Colorized buttons do not change their color until the application
                has been restarted.
