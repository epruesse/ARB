TITLE		Help on configurations

OCCURRENCE	Anywhere (buttons with config icon)

DESCRIPTION     This provides a general way to store and restore settings
                from the window, where this has been called from.

                - STORE: stores current settings into properties.
                - RESTORE: restores settings from properties.
                - DELETE: delete stored settings from properties
                - SAVE: RESTORE stored settings and save them to a file 
                - LOAD: load settings from a file, STORE and RESTORE

NOTES		To save stored settings permanently, use SAVE PROPERTIES!

                Saving configurations allows you to share them with other users.
                The configs are saved in directory pointed to by environmentvariable
                ARBCONFIG (which defaults to ~/.arb_prop/cfgSave). See also LINK{arb_envar.hlp}.

EXAMPLES	None

WARNINGS	None

BUGS		Deleted settings remain in properties (inaccessible!)
