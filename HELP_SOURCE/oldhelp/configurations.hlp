TITLE		Help on configurations

OCCURRENCE	Anywhere (buttons with config icon)

DESCRIPTION     This provides a general way to store and restore settings
                from the window, where this has been called from.

                - Restore: restores a named configuration (from properties)
                - Store: store current settings as named configuration (into properties)
                - Delete: delete named configuration
                - Load: load settings from a file, STORE and RESTORE
                - Save: RESTORE stored settings and save them to a file
                - Factory defaults: reset all values to their defaults

		You may enter a description for each stored configuration.

NOTES		To keep stored settings permanently (i.e. for future arb sessions), 
		use 'Save properties' from the 'Properties' menu!

                Saving configurations allows you to share them with other users.
                The configs are saved in directory pointed to by environmentvariable
                ARBCONFIG (which defaults to ~/.arb_prop/cfgSave). See also LINK{arb_envar.hlp}.

		Predefined (hardcoded) configurations are marked by a leading '*'.
		You may only restore or save such configurations.
