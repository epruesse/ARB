TITLE		Estimate Parameters from Coloumn Statistics

OCCURRENCE	ARB_DIST

DESCRIPTION	In a standart RNA, base frequencies are not equally
		distributed. Especially in the archea subclass we find
		extremely G+C rich sequences.
		This yielded in a couple of new rate corrections, algorhythms
		and programs which:
			- calculate the average G+C content of all/two
				sequences
			- correct the distance.

		But further research showed us that the G+C frequencies are
		not equally distributed within a sequence. Especially helical
		parts have a significant higher G+C content than non
		helical parts.
		One strait forward algorhythm would calculate each frequency
		independently for each coloumn.
		Especially for small datasets the resulting frequencies would
		look like random data, as too few examples are analyzed.

		In ARB we implemented a combination of the 2 approaches.
			Lets say we want to estimate a Parameter 'P' with
			a maximum variance 'maxvar', so we need a minumum
			samples 'minsap'.
			- All sequence positions a clustered according to
				. helical/non helical region
				. variability
			   The size of the cluster is choosen with respect
			   to the variability of the sequences to get a
			   minimum of independent events.
			-  The final parameter estimate for a coloumn is a 
			   weighted sum between the estimate for the
			   cluster and the estimate for the single position. 			   
		You can give your favourite method a higher weight by
		controlling the smothing parameter:

			Less smoothing -> independent parameter estimates

			Much smoothing -> clustered parameter estimates
		
		To get a good tree we recommend you to try all selections.

NOTES		To get parameters from a column statistic you first have
		to create one.
		Do this with
			<ARB_NT/SAI/Positional Variability (Parsimony M.)>

WARNINGS	Problems may occur when
			 1. independent parameter estimates is selected
			+2. your dataset is quit small (<100 Sequences)
			+3. One sequence is bad or badly aligned
		or
			 1. Much smoothing of parameters is selected
			+2. Your are anlazing ribosomal RNA
			+3. 'Use Helix Information' is turned off
