TITLE		What are Organisms?

OCCURRENCE	Everywhere

DESCRIPTION     An Organism is a special kind of species.

                It contains the whole genom sequence of a micro-organism
                in an alignment called 'ali_genom'. The sequence stored in
                that alignment has to be unaligned (=no gaps).

                Further it contains information about genes.

                Organisms do not occur in a normal ARB database (i.e. a 16s database).
                To work with organisms you have to import a genome-flatfile into a new database.

NOTES		To create alignments of genes you need to create gene-species.

EXAMPLES	None

WARNINGS	None

BUGS		No bugs known
