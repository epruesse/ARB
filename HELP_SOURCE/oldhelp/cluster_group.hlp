TITLE		Cluster groups

OCCURRENCE	ARB_DIST/Detect clusters/Cluster groups

DESCRIPTION     Choose whether you like to create (or delete) groups for all 'listed clusters' or
                for the currently 'selected cluster' only.

                Specify the wanted identity between cluster and the subtree, where the group will
                be created. If you just calculated clusters (for the tree currently selected in the
                ARB_DIST main window) the identity will always be 100%.
                Specifying a lower identity value, allows to apply groups to a different tree.

                Click on 'create groups' to create groups for affected clusters.

                It might happen, that your tree already contains groups, where this function
                likes to insert new ones. In this case you can choose to either

                      - abort (the default)
                      - skip
                      - overwrite with generated name or
                      - overwrite and append original group name.

                You can specify a name prefix for the generated group names.

                The rest of the name is generated from the 'Name suffix' specification.
                This specification may contain normal text and the following codes:

                     %p            position in upgroup (which don't start with cluster prefix)
                     %P            position in upgroup
                     %t            position in tree
                     %d            mean distance of cluster
                     %D            max allowed distance (as set in input field)
                     %o            "..%_of" (only occurs when applying to different tree topology)
                     %e            existing group-name
                     %%            %

                Click on 'delete groups' to erase groups existing at cluster subtrees. You can select
                to remove all groups or only groups matching the name prefix.

NOTES		This function always affects the tree currently selected in the ARB_DIST main window.

EXAMPLES	None

WARNINGS	Be careful when using 'overwrite' without appending original names.
                It will destroy existing groups.

BUGS		No bugs known
