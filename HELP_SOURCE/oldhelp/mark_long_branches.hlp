TITLE		Mark long branches

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT

DESCRIPTION	Badly aligned sequences often result in long branches in the
		tree. Being able to identify those branches quickly helps to
		find those sequences.
		The programs allows to mark all species having an extra
		long branch compared to it's nearest neighbour.
		

NOTES		Play around and try different numbers.
		

BUGS		The program does not show all extra long branches because
		then the output won't be user readable. So after fixing
		the alignment of sequences and recalculating the branch
		lengths, there might be new sequences with extra long 
		branches.
