		be listed by pressing the appropriate combination of buttons
		in the top area.

		marked or in all species.

		When performing multiple searches, define whether the list of
		'genes'	should be replaced by the new results, and whether
		newly found 'genes' should be removed from or appended to the
		existing list.
