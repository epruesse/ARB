TITLE		ROTATE MODE

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT <eighth button in the left column>
		F9 on the keyboard

DESCRIPTION	The 'ROTATE MODE' allows you to rotate branches or subtrees
		of the displayed tree.

		Click on the <eighth button in the left column> of the
			'ARB_NT' window or press the 'F9' key on the keyboard to
			activate the 'ROTATE MODE'. In the latter case, the
			cursor has to be placed within the tree display area.

		Rotate terminal branch:

			Move the cursor to any position along the
			branch, keep the left mouse button pressed while
			moving the cursor, release the button to fix the
			position of the branch.

		Rotate subtree:

			Move the cursor to any position along the edge defining
			the subtree and proceed as described above.

			The subtree-defining branch is that located closest to
			the indicated root (open square) of the whole tree
			which is directly or indirectly connected to all branches of the
			subtree.


NOTES		Short descriptions of the 'MODE' and the functions assigned
		to the mouse buttons are given in the fourth line of the
		'ARB_NT' window.

		The displayed tree topology is exported to the drawing
		tool xfig.

		The middle mouse button (placed anywhere within the tree
		display area) can be used to move the whole tree.

		The scale bar and its label can be moved by positioning the
		cursor anywhere on the bar, keeping the left mouse button
		pressed, moving the cursor to the desired position and sub-
		sequently releasing the mouse button. The label of the bar
		can be moved independently.

		The previous topology can be restored using the 'RESET MODE'
		('RESET' button on the 'ARB_NT' window).
