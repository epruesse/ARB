TITLE		What are color groups?

DESCRIPTION     Color groups are groups of species (genes, experiments, ..).
                Every species can only belong to ONE color group.

                All species of one color group are displayed in the
                same color in the tree display.

NOTES		The colors used to display can be customized with
                'Properties/Tree: Color and fonts/Edit color groups'

                It's possible to toggle between marks and colors using
                'ARB_NTREE/Species/Colors'
