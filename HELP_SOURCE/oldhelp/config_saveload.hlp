TITLE		Editor configurations

OCCURRENCE	ARB_EDIT4/File/... configuration

DESCRIPTION     Editor configurations define

                 * which species, groups and SAI will be shown inside the editor,
                 * whether any of these is placed in the top area (always visible) or bottom area (scrollable) and
                 * which groups are folded (in the editor).

                Each configuration has a unique name and is part of the database,
                i.e. to save (changed) configurations, save your database.

                Such configurations can be generated in three ways:

                 * using 'File/Save configuration as' in ARB_EDIT4
                 * when starting ARB_EDIT4 as described as 'Standard' or 'Plus relatives' in LINK{arb_edit4.hlp} a
                   configuration named "default_configuration" will be automatically created or overwritten.
                 * using the configuration manager (see LINK{configuration.hlp})

                Using the first method gives you complete control over what exactly is stored in
                the configuration.
                The other two methods will
                 * always add all SAIs associated with the selected alignment (and fold them as defined; see LINK{ad_extended.hlp})
                 * always use the folding of the currently displayed tree

                Description of configuration entries in ARB_EDIT4 "File" menu:

                  * Save configuration

                    Saves any changes made to the currently loaded configuration.
                    Note that it does not make much sense to save the "default_configuration" as it
                    may be overwritten when the editor is started next time.

                  * Save configuration as ...

                    Save the current state of the editor as named configuration for future editor restarts.

                  * Load configuration

                    Switches to a previously stored configuration.

                    Similar to closing the editor and restarting it using a named configuration.

                  * Reload configuration

                    Reloads the loaded configuration (i.e. undos all configuration changes made since
                    startup or last save of configuration)
