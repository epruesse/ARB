TITLE		Move node info

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/Tree/Copy_Del.../Move Node Info

DESCRIPTION	Move the internal group labels from one tree to another. If
		the trees are different, the program will try to guess where to
		put the inner node labels. If a node cannot be places optimal,
		then a message is generated.

		Select the (source) tree with the node labels in the left
		selection list and the destination tree in the right selection
		list.

		If you press 'Copy info' all nodes in the destination
		tree get deleted and the new nodes are inserted instead.

		If you press 'Add info' the nodes in the destination tree
		are renamed ('newname [was: oldname]') and non-existing nodes
		from the source tree are inserted.

		If you check 'only info containing marked species' only groups
		containing at least one marked species are moved to the
		destination tree.

NOTES		None

EXAMPLES	None

WARNINGS	It's slow..
