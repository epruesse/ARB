TITLE		Save Database

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/File/Save

DESCRIPTION	To save the entire database, choose 'Save Whole Database'
		from the 'File' menu of the 'ARB_NT' window.

                You may also save only the changes to the database
		with the 'Save Changes' or 'Save Changes as'
		functions.

                        'Save Changes' saves all changes to the database
                        'data.arb' to a file 'data.aXX' where X is a number
                        between 0 and 99 starting with 1. {**huh? Between 1 and 99?**}

                        This is normally much faster than saving the entire database and
                        results in much less disc consumption.

                        Each time you save your changes, X is increased by one.
                        The last 5 old data.aXX are not deleted and allow you to
                        step to an old state.

                        All data.aXX are independent and you may
                        delete old changes files without losing data (as long as the
                        latest is unchanged)

		When you start arb you can choose among the different files:

                         enter 'arb filename.arb' to search and load the latest changes,

                         enter 'arb filename.aXX' to load a user-defined version.


NOTES		None

WARNINGS	None

BUGS		Not all changes to the database can be saved into a small file -
		especially, changing the order of database entries disables
		a quick save.
		Hopefully no real bugs.
