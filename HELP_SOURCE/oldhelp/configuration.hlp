TITLE		Selection of Species ( == Configurations )

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NTREE/Species/Selections

DESCRIPTION	Each species is either marked or unmarked. All species that are
		marked are called marked species. In order to handle multiple
		sets of marked species we use configurations ( = a selection of species).

                Several operations are possible with the configurations:

                        - STORE (save a (new) configuration)
                        - EXTRACT (= unmark all, then mark those from configuration)
                        - MARK/UNMARK/INVERT (mix currently marked species with those marked in configuration)
                        - DELETE (delete a configuration)
                        - RENAME (not implemented yet)

		Each configuration has a unique name and is part of the database.
                The current tree displayed within the ARB_NT main window is stored
                with the configuration.

		ARB_EDIT4 may load all marked species or all species stored in a configuration.

NOTES		Saving the database means also saving all configurations.
