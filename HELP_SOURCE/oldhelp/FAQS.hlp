QUESTION	I have no tree. How can I get one ??

ANSWER		See LINK{no_tree.hlp}

QUESTION When I'm using the Phylip tools for building trees, the program skips over
         the Phylip menu (except in ARB_NT, Phylip Distance Methods). It is,
         therefore, not possible to use the Phylip options, e.g. to select an
         outgroup when doing bootstrap analysis.


ANSWER	There is a second menu-button in the tree-build sub-menu which starts
        the original phylip programs with interactive access to all parameters.


QUESTION It would be nice to be able to close a database without having to exit ARB.

ANSWER	Sorry, that would be to complicated to program.


QUESTION Finally, do you have a 23S alignment, that I could use? I have tryed to
         build my own, based on the sequences available from RDP. But that's only 34
         sequences, and when I align my own 23S sequences against those, the computer
         runs out of memory. I hope this problem can be solved by putting some more
         memory in the computer (I currently have 64 mb RAM and I'm going to double
         that). The shorter 16S sequences causes no problems. Anyway, I would be
         thankfull if a 23S alignment could be made available.

ANSWER	Wolfgang Ludwig has a 23s alignment with 500 Sequences. I will ask
        him to give it to me and you.


QUESTION When I try to start the aligner V1.0 or V2.0 I get a message:
	 libARBDB.so.2 not found, Aligner failed

ANSWER  You are probably using the LINUX operating system and have not
	installed arb under root account. Please login as root and run
	the arb_install program again, but don't update the old package.
