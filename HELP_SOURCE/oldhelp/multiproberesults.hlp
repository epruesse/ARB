TITLE		Multiproberesults


DESCRIPTION	Shows the best multi-probes. Each multi-probe has a score, the
		higher the score the better.

		The user may add any string as a comment (or one of the
		three default comments)

		The selected multi-probe can be used to set the colors
		at the tips at the tree. First probe will be red, the
		second green, the third blue. If multiple probes hit a
                species it is displayed in mix-colors of red, green and blue.

NOTE		If you do not see any colors, the colors
                in 'Properties/Tree-Colors' are probably misconfigured.
