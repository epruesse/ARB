TITLE		What is an Alignment ?

DESCRIPTION	Different alignments assigned to the same species (eg. sequences
		of different genes) can be stored in one database.
		The name of the currently accessible alignment (ali_*) is shown
		in the 3rd broad rectangular button in the top area of the
 		ARB_NT window.

		The sequences themselves are not stored in the 'ali_*' field of
		a species, but in the subfield 'data' of 'ali_*'
		'ali_*' is a container field: it holds no data
		except other data fields (like a directory in a file system).

NOTE            There is a special alignment called 'ali_genom' which is used
                for full genome databases.
                It's called an alignment because it fits into our database structure,
                but it should NOT contain any gaps.
