TITLE		Mark by reference

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/Species/Mark by reference

DESCRIPTION     Allows to mark all species referred to in the content of a field.

		Select whether to check all or marked species.

                Enter name of field containing references.

                      A reference is a single species ID ('name') or a comma-, semicolon-
                      or space-separated list of species IDs.

                Choose whether
                       - to abort if the field is missing or
                       - to continue w/o warning

		Enter an ACI expression (see LINK{aci.hlp}) to postprocess
		the field content. The result must be a reference or 
		reference-list (see above).

		The default ACI is '/[0-9.]+[%]*://'. This works with 
		several common references (like 'used_rels' from fast-aligner or
		relatives written by 'Search next relatives')

		    Below the ACI there are 3 lines showing
			- the selected species
			- the content of its field
			- the result after processing it through the ACI

                Choose whether
                       - to abort if an unknown reference is found or
                       - to continue w/o warning

                Click 'Mark referenced' to mark all species which are referenced
                by the examined set of species.
