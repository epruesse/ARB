TITLE		Nearest relatives of SELECTED 

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/Search/More search/Search Next Relatives of SELECTED Species in PT Server

DESCRIPTION	Scans PT_SERVER database for the nearest relatives
		of the currently selected species.

SECTION         DESCRIPTION

                See LINK{next_neighbours_common.hlp} for a description of the used algorithm
                and common parameters.

                When you press the SEARCH button, the next relatives of the selected species are listed
                in the Hits-box.

                If you check 'Auto on selection change' the search will start everytime the currently
                selected species changes.

                Then number of species listed there is limited by the number given in
                the 'Results' field. Enter 0 to get unlimited output.

                When you press the 'Move to hitlist' button, the species list is transferred to
                the species search result list, where you're able to apply further actions to the
                found relatives.
                  * Depending on the settings of 'Search/Add/Keep species' in the main query-window
                    the species list is either replaced, added or kept.
                  * Depending on the setting of 'that match/don't match the query' either the list of
                    found relatives is applied or the rest of the species.

                When you press the 'Mark hits' button, all species listed in the 'Hits' list will be
                marked (and all other species will be unmarked).

                If you check 'Auto' behind the 'Mark hits' button this will be done automatically
                after each search.

NOTES		Try auto-mark together with auto-search!
