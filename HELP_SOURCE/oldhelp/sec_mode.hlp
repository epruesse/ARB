TITLE		ARB_SECEDIT modes

OCCURRENCE	ARB_SECEDIT/mode buttons

DESCRIPTION	ZOOM MODE       Mode to zoom the displayed secondary structure.

			You can zoom in by dragging a rectangle with the
			left mouse button.

			You can zoom out by clicking or dragging the right mouse button.

		HELIX MODE	Mode to build and destroy helix regions.

			Left mouse button converts the clicked loop region
			into a helix region (if possible).

			Right mouse button removes the clicked helix region.

                        Hint: If you display SAI: HELIX it's easy to detect the helix
                              regions.

		SET ROOT MODE

			Left click on a loop which should be the fixpoint of your
			secondary structure.
                        The root loop will not move if you create or remove helix
                        region nor if you rotate branches of the secondary structure.
                        
                        Right click onto a loop or helix to reset the angles between it and
                        its neighbours.

		ROTATE MODE 

                        Left click onto a helix or loop to rotate it (and its complete
                        substructure).

                        Use right click to rotate w/o rotating the substructure.

		STRETCH MODE    

			Left click and drag a helix or loop to stretch or compress its size.

                        Right click to remove size constraints.

                CONSTRAINT MODE 

                        Left click on a helix or loop and edit its size constraints manually.

                SET CURSOR MODE 

                        Left click on a base character to set the cursor position in the
                        primary structure editor.

                PROBE INFO MODE

                        Left click on
