TITLE		MOVE MODE

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT <button in the left column>

DESCRIPTION	The 'MOVE MODE' allows to change the topology of the
		displayed tree by moving subtrees.

		Click on the <MOVE> button in the left column of
                the 'ARB_NT' window.

		Move subtree:

                     Drag and drop a branch onto a target branch, to remove the branch
                     from the tree and insert it next to the target branch.

		Move Group Info:

                     Use the right mouse button to move the group information only.
                     When dropped onto another group, both group informations will be
                     exchanged.

SECTION         ARB_PARSIMONY specific

		Within the 'ARB_PARSIMONY' window, this mode can be used to test
		tree topologies with respect to maximum parsimony criteria by
		moving subtrees. The current parsimony value is shown after the
		'Current Par' prompt and can be compared with the 'Optimum Par'
		value of the initial tree.


NOTES		Short descriptions of the 'MODE' and the functions assigned
		to the mouse buttons are given in the fourth line of the
		'ARB_NT' window.

		The displayed tree topology is exported to the drawing
		tool xfig.

		The middle mouse button (placed anywhere within the tree
		display area) can be used to move the whole tree.

		The scale bar and its label can be moved by positioning the
		cursor anywhere on the bar, keeping the left mouse button
		pressed, moving the cursor to the desired position and
                subsequently releasing the mouse button. The label of the bar
		can be moved independently.


EXAMPLES	None

WARNINGS	!!! No 'undo' function available yet !!!
