OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/species

DESCRIPTION     Allow the user to select a appropriate valid name from the list

                available names can be made by giving any number of initial characters.
                A name selection in the list can then assigned to the current selected species
                and is written to the fiels Valid_Names/NameString, description type then is manually.
