        Use the scroll bars:

            and press the left button (note: the cursor is placed

            position next right to the cursor)

            to move the editor cursor (it has to be placed somewhere
            before) to a given alignment position type a (position)
            number in one of the 'Position' (absolute alignment
            position - characters and gaps), 'E.coli' (homologous
            position in the E. coli standard), 'Base' (position in the
            current sequence - only characters, no gaps) or 'Helix #'
            (5'-end of 3' helix half; type a '-' for 5'-end of the 5'
            helix half) and move the mouse cursor back to the editing
            area of the ARB_EDIT4 window.
