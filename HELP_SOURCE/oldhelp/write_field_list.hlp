TITLE           WRITE TO FIELDS OF LISTED SPECIES/GENES

OCCURRENCE      ARB_NT/Species/Search: WRITE TO FIELDS OF LISTED
                ARB_NT/Genes/Search: WRITE TO FIELDS OF LISTED

DESCRIPTION     Writes the same text or integers to the selected fields of
                all listed species/genes.

NOTES           A protection level has to be selected from the Protection
                menu of the main window (ARB_NT/Protection) equal or higher
                than that assigned to the selected alignment (ARB_NT/ali_*;
                third broad rectangular button in the upper part of the
                main window).

EXAMPLES

                1. Write a date of sequence modification (03.27.95) to the
                fields 'date' of all listed species and replace
                former entries of these fields:

                        Select 'Field' by pressing:     'date'
                        Type 'Text or integer':         '03.27.95'
                        Press:                          'WRITE'

                2. Add the initials of the modifying person (OS) to the
                   entries stored in the fields 'date' of all listed
                   species:

                        Select 'Field' by pressing:     'date'
                        Type 'Text or integer':         'OS'
                        Press:                          'APPEND'


WARNINGS        Except for the 'name' field (the identifier), there are no different protection
                levels for different fields. Take care not to write to fields
                which should contain unique entries for the corresponding
                species/genes such as accession numbers.
