TITLE		 Tree Settings

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/Properties/Tree Settings
                ARB_PARSIMONY/Properties/Tree: Settings

DESCRIPTION     Various tree display settings are available:

                - 'Base line width' defines the thickness of branches

                - 'Relative vertical distance' allows to stretch the tree in
                  vertical direction (dendrogram only)

                - 'On species change' and 'On tree change' provide similar behavior as the
                  JUMP button in the top area of the main window. These settings define
                  whether and how the selected species should be repositioned inside the viewport,
                  when either the species or the tree (or tree display mode) changes.

                The following settings are only available in ARB_NT:

                - 'Show bootstrap circles' toggles the display of bootstrap circles (only
                  available if the tree contains bootstrap values).

                - If 'Use ellipse' is active, ellipses instead of circles are drawn in
                  dendrogram tree.

                - 'Bootstrap circle zoom factor' allows to increase/reduce the size
                  of the boostrap circles/ellipse

                - 'Boostrap radius limit' allows to limit the max. bootstrap circle/ellipse size.

                - 'Grey Level of Groups%' (for printing/Xfig only)

                - Text zoom/pad
                  Select toggle to consider text for default zoom (otherwise only tree-structure is considered).
                  Add extra padding in pixel (= amount of extra space for text; may be negative)

NOTES		The line width of individual branches can be changed
		independently using the 'LINE WIDTH MODE'.
