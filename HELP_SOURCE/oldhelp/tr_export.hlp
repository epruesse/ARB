        NEWICK TREE FORMAT

               Nodetype

                      Species name

                              This is the normal format using species names as leaf names.

                      NDS

                              (Export only!) This uses the current NDS tree settings as leaf names.

               Save branch lengths

                    if marked, branchlengths are written to the tree file.

               Save bootstraps

                    if marked, bootstraps are written to the tree file.

               Save groupnames

                    if marked, groupnames are written to the tree file.


        ORS TANSFER BINARY FORMAT

        		Special format used by our database administrators.
                        You need a special program to use it.


NOTES           If you select both 'Save groupnames' and 'Save bootstraps', other programs may be
                unable to load the tree or at least unable to interpret the bootstrap values correctly.

                If a suffix is displayed in or typed to the 'SUFFIX' subwindow,
		only the corresponding file names will be displayed. The suffix
		is automatically appended to the file name typed to the 'FILE
		NAME' subwindow.


WARNINGS	Tree data written with the 'NDS' option cannot be
		reimported to the database without data loss!

                It's possible to reload such a tree, but it's leafs
                will not be linked to the correct species.
