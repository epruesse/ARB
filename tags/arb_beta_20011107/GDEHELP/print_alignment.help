Print selection

Sends the selected sequences to the chosen printer.  The sequences are printed
in aligned form with the sequence short name and the current position number
on the left.


Printer choices need to be set up by your system's administrator.  These
can be set in the .GDEmenus file in your local directory or in the GDE_HELP_DIR
directory.
