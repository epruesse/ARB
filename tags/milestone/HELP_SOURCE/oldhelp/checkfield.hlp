TITLE           Determine sequence changes between different databases

OCCURRENCE      ARB_MERGE/Transfer Species/Source->Target/Compare a field of listed species...

DESCRIPTION     Compares contents of a field (selected to compare) between same species in 
                both databases. Information about found differences will be stored in
                the selected report field in both databases.

                Only species listed in the left hitlist of the 'TRANSFER SPECIES' window
                are examined.

                If no differences are detected, the selected report field will be deleted
                from the species.

                Comparison can be customized by the following parameters:

                 * tag/subfield

                   If a tag is specified, only the content belonging to that tag will
                   be considered for comparison (see LINK{tags.hlp} for information about tagging).

                 * ignore characters

                   When specified, the contents of the field are modified before comparison, i.e. the
                   given characters are removed from the contents.
                   Nevertheless, the position(s) written to the report field are independant of
                   ignored characters, i.e. they are absolute (sequence) positions.

                 * ignore case

                   When checked case differences are ignored.

                If 'Try to correct field in target DB' is checked, ARB will accept and correct
                single(!) insertions, deletions and substitutions in the sequence data of the
                target database.
                A minimum amount of 10 matching bases is required between two distinct corrections,
                otherwise the correction will be canceled (and diff-info will be written to report field).
                Successful corrections are indicated by marking the affected species in the target database.

NOTES           This function has been designed to determine sequence changes between different database(s) (versions).
                Using it for other data fields works.

EXAMPLES        None

WARNINGS        Be careful: Select only report fields, that don't contain any data (it will be deleted)!

BUGS            No bugs known
