TITLE		PT_SERVER Administration

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/Probes/PT_SERVER Admin

DESCRIPTION	Allows you to start/kill and build/update 'PT_SERVER'
		databases.

		Select a 'PT_SERVER' and database from the menu displayed after
                pressing the button below the 'PT_SERVER' prompt.

		Start or kill the selected 'PT_SERVER' by pressing the
                corresponding buttons.

		Press the 'BUILD SERVER' button to export the current database
                to the selected 'PT_SERVER' database.

                In Genome Databases you may check the 'Gene server' toggle to
                build a PT-Server which is based on the sequences of the single
                genes (and intergene regions) of all organisms.

                Such a PT-Server allows to perform similarity searches and probe
                design/match for single genes (in opposite to whole genomes with
                a "normal" PT-Server).

                When designing probes with such a gene PT-Server you always have
                to validate these probes against a PT-Server build upon complete
                genome sequences, otherwise you will get incorrect results for all
                probes matching at beginning/end of a gene.


NOTES		Read PT_SERVER: What Why and How if you do not understand this
		helptext.

		The probe designing and matching tools ('ARB_PROBE') and the
		aligner of the editor ('ARB_EDIT4') rely on 'PT_SERVER'
		databases and servers.

                Update (re-build) the 'PT_SERVER' database when new
		sequence (species) entries or sequence modifications (base
		changes) have been introduced into the current database.

EXAMPLES	None

WARNINGS	None
