TITLE		ARB Parsimony

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/Tree/Add species to existing tree/Parsimony ...

DESCRIPTION	In this release, 'ARB Parsimony' cannot be used to reconstruct
		new trees.

		Existing trees can be optimized at different levels (depths)
		according to maximum parsimony criteria.

		New sequences (species) can be placed rapidly into an existing
		tree. This can be done without changing that tree or allowing
		optimization at different levels according to maximum parsimony
		criteria including the new information for calculation.

		Filters for the in- or exclusion of alignment columns
		('ARB_NT/SAI; ARB_NT/Tree/Dist Matrix) can be seleted.

                After selecting one of the parsimony items in 'Tree/Add species to existing tree'
		the 'SET PARSIMONY OPTIONS' window appears:

		- Select the tree (to be modified) from the 'Tree:' subwindow.

		- Select an 'alignment' (see LINK{glossary.hlp}) from the
                  'alignment:' subwindow.

		- To select a filter display the 'Select Filter' window pressing
                  the button after the 'Filter:' prompt (see LINK{sel_fil.hlp}).

		- Press the <GO> button to display the 'ARB_PARSIMONY' window.
