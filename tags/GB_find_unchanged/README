************ Hardware and System Requirements **************

	As ARB is still under construction, there are only a limited number of
	operating systems which can run ARB.

	Today it is available for:

		SUN Solaris >2.4
		Linux for PC
        Max OS              (not supplied by ARB-Team)

    Older versions availiable for:

		SUN OS 4.1.x
		Silicon Graphics >5.0
		HP UX			        (not working properly)
		Digital OSF

******************* The most often question ever asked ***************
********************** Should I buy a SUN or PC ??? *********************

	If you have already a network of old SUN computers buy a sun. In all
	other cases buy a PC. We are just building our own PC network so we can
	test the PC version very carefully. A PC is faster and cheaper than a SUN.
	You should buy: A pentium pro board, min. 128 mByte better 256mByte of RAM,
	17/21 inch Monitor + graphics card, which should be linux compatible
	and can show an effective resolution of 1280x1040 at 70hz. Without the RAM
	and the montitor you may test ARB but it won't be fun using it. Linux is
	a public domain unix and should not costs more than 50USD. You should find
	a PC seller who can preinstall Linux on your PC.
