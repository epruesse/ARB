arb_probe_server_worker
-----------------------

Start one arb_probe_server_worker process for each probe database
(there's one for each supported probe length).

This process scans its working directory for incoming requests. These
request files shall be provided by different cgi scripts. Each request
will be answered by one response file.

File name conventions:

     Request files:  $PL_$PID_$NUM.req
     Response files: $PL_$PID_$NUM.res

     where:
        $PL         probe length (15-20)
        $PID        process id of the cgi
        $NUM        unique request number
