ToDo for arb_probe_library:
===========================

* ../PROBE_WEB/CLIENT/ToDo

------------------------------------------------------------
* General:

** Hide the RESERVED pt-server in ARB selection lists

------------------------------------------------------------
* cgis:

** all scripts that wait for server answer
   should do a timeout (maybe check whether server is running)

** when merging probes from multiple servers: it may happen, that one server
   knows about a group and the other doesn't -> don't show error

------------------------------------------------------------
* Database-Format:

** remove 'comb' entries

------------------------------------------------------------
* PROBE_GROUP:

** probe_match ignores 'use_weighted_mismatches' (this is not in config yet)
   and temperature, gccontent and ecoli_pos
   (this is most likely the reason why design and match give different results)

** for all subtrees w/o exact probes:
*** search for non-group-hit probe groups

** for coverage-branches only:
   propagate groups upwards if they are equal to best group 
   (currently only propagated if better)
   => store multiple groups in 'coverage_id'

** some nodes have no probes [bug]
*** one cause was: probe_match had result, probe_design not
    'exact' entry was not deleted in that case [FIXED]

** extract probe ecoli-position from pt-server result and
   store together with probe

** not only collect probes for subtrees, but also for inverse of
   subtree (aka rest of tree)

------------------------------------------------------------
* PROBE_GROUP_DESIGN:

** store probe ecoli-position (not possible, if design is not performed)

------------------------------------------------------------
* TREE_MERGE:

** use best coverage value (+coverage group name)

------------------------------------------------------------
* WORKER:

** transfer probe ecoli-position

------------------------------------------------------------
