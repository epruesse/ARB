TITLE		SAI Sequence Associated Information

DESCRIPTION	The main database divides all sequences into two groups:

                    1. Species sequences -> Species
                    2. All other sequences -> SAI ( masks, filters, profiles )

		You should keep the number of SAI's small for you cannot:

			- search SAI's
			- select a subset of SAI's
			- exclude SAI's from the ARB_EDITor


SECTION         IMPLEMENTED SAI's

		ECOLI

                        A copy of the E.coli sequence. It is used to convert
                        the absolute alignment position into
                        an E.coli-based position and vice versa.
                        (Note: you may use any other sequence instead of ECOLI. The
                        name displayed in the EDITOR can be modified using Properties/NDS)

		HELIX_NR

                        Helix Numbering

		HELIX

                        and Helix template
