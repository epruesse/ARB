The libs in this directory are provided together with ARB, because
there are several systems lacking these libraries (or the versions
needed by ARB).

If you start ARB using the script 'arb' (and you should do so)
this directory will be appended to the library paths.

So if the needed libraries are not installed in your system, the
libraries from this directory will be used.

(Note: not all releases provide libraries here)
