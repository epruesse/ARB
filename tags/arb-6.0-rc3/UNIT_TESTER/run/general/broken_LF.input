The ARB software is a graphically oriented package comprising various tools for
sequence database handling and data analysis. A central database of processed
(aligned) sequences and any type of additional data linked to the respective
sequence entries is structured according to phylogeny or other user defined
criteria. Take a look at some features.  To get a quick impression, see how we
presented ARB on several conferences.
