TITLE		What are Genes ?

DESCRIPTION	One gene is one database entry containing subentries which
                describe the gene. Every gene belongs to a specific
		organism, but one organism may have many genes.

                Main (reserved) entries of a gene:

                     name, pos_begin, pos_end, complement,
                     pos_joined, pos_begin1, pos_end1, pos_begin2, pos_end2, ...
                     pos_uncertain,
                     codon_start, transl_table

                See LINK{gene_info.hlp} for details about these fields.

NOTE		The main-sequence of a organism(species) is stored in the
		alignment 'ali_genom'. You should not change this alignment.
                
WARNINGS	The alignment 'ali_genom' should NOT contain any gaps!!!!

BUGS		No known bugs
