TITLE		Realign DNA

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/Sequence/Align sequences/Realign nucleic acid according to aligned protein

DESCRIPTION     If you have translated DNA sequences into protein sequences and then have aligned
                the resulting protein sequences, this function can be used to re-align the
                DNA sequences according to the (modified) protein alignment.

                Simply select the protein and the corresponding DNA alignment and press 'REALIGN'
                to re-align the DNA sequences of all marked species. 

NOTES		If the species contains a field 'transl_table' (which should contain the translation table
                number as used by the EMBL database) it is used to detect the correct translation table.
                If no such field is defined a translation-table-auto-detection takes place.

                If the species contains a field 'codon_start' it is overwritten with '1' to make
                further translations work properly.

EXAMPLES	None

WARNINGS	If you have single DNA bases at the beginning (or end) of the DNA sequence
                there have to be corresponding proteins in the protein sequence. Otherwise translation
                will fail.

                Normally, if you use codon start other than 1 during translation, a 'X' will be inserted
                into the resulting protein sequence. That X is required by the re-aligner to skip up to
                3 DNA positions, while it is trying to find the correct ORF.

                Missing X's at protein sequence start are a very common cause,
                for various kinds of error messages from the re-aligner.

BUGS		No bugs known
