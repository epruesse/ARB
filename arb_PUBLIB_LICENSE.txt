ARB-public-library-license
--------------------------

This license covers the following ARB-libraries:

 - CORE-library
 - ARBDB-library
 - PTSERVER-library
 - PT_COM-library
 - all ARB libraries needed by any of the above libraries.

   Currently these are:
    - PTCLEAN,
    - HELIX,
    - SERVERCNTRL and
    - server + client (PROBE_COM).

 These libraries currently cover the following subdirectories of the ARB source tree:
   - ARBDB
   - CORE
   - PROBE
   - PROBE_COM
   - SERVERCNTRL
   - SL/HELIX
   - SL/PTCLEAN


The ARB libraries listed above may be used by projects distributed under the Gnu public
license (GPL) under the following conditions:

 * a copy of the ARB license (arb_LICENSE.txt) is provided
 * a copy of the ARB public library license (arb_PUBLIB_LICENSE.txt) is provided
 * all copyright notices remain intact when redistributing the source code
 * you may use unmodified or modified versions of these libraries:
   - when using MODIFIED versions of these libraries, the modified source code has to be
     distributed together with your project or made available for free public download.
     Please note that by doing so the ARB project and its maintainers gain the right to
     adopt your changes into ARB.
   - when using UNMODIFIED versions of these libraries, you may (but don't need to)
     provide the library sources. If not provided, you have to add a reference to the
     arb-version that has been used.

All files which are part of ARB and which are needed to build the above mentioned
libraries, may be distributed together with your project (but do not fall under the
ARB-public-library-license themselves).

Config files needed by the above libraries may be freely copied (e.g. arb_tcp.dat).

This license does only grant additional terms of use for the covered libraries,
while the main ARB license still remains valid for them.

The ARB maintainers may (but most likely ever wont) cancel this license for future
versions of ARB. Doing so will not affect earlier versions of arb distributed together
with this license.

If you'd like to use these libraries in a project distributed under a different license
than GPL, please ask us for permission to do so.
