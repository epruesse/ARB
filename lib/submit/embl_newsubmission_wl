EMBL NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE DATABASE SUBMISSION FORM

HOW TO USE THIS FORM - PLEASE READ FIRST

1) WEBIN: THE WORLD WIDE WEB SUBMISSION TOOL
============================================
If you have access to the World Wide Web then DO NOT use this form. Use the
WebIn form on the World Wide Web at 

           ##############################################
           # http://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/webin.html #
           ##############################################

If you do not have access to the World Wide Web then please use this form
and email it to DATASUBS@EBI.AC.UK. 

It is only necessary to submit to one database. Public data are exchanged
between EMBL, GenBank and DDBJ on a daily basis. 

2) MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS
=======================
If you have more than one but less than 25 sequences to submit, copy this
form and send all the submissions together in one email with a note saying
how many sequences you are sending.

3) BULK SUBMISSIONS
===================
If you have more than 25 related sequences to submit DO NOT send them all
using this form. Instead email DATASUBS@EBI.AC.UK and include the following
information
a) how many sequences you are going to submit
b) a short explanation of how the sequences are related
c) what type of differences there are between the entries (e.g. isolate)
d) one completed email submission form as an example
You will be contacted by a curator who will create a template for you which
you should then use to submit all of the sequences.

4) UPDATES
==========
DO NOT use this form for submitting updates or corrections.
If you are sending an update please complete the update form available on
the web at: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebi_docs/update.html or get a copy of the
update form via anonymous FTP: 
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/embl/release/update.doc
If you need help with updates contact UPDATE@EBI.AC.UK

5) PROTEIN SEQUENCES
====================
DO NOT use this form to submit protein sequences.
For submissions to the SWISS-PROT protein sequence databank access the
World Wide Web at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebi_docs/swissprot_db/swisshome.html
or email DATALIB@EBI.AC.UK

6) ACCESSION NUMBERS AND CONFIDENTIALITY
========================================
Your data can be made public immediately, or they can be kept confidential
until a release date which you provide. Confidential data are ALWAYS made
available to the public after publication.

If your data contain all the information we require we will assign unique
accession numbers within two working days. We will email you to tell you
the new accession numbers.

You should submit your sequence data BEFORE you have galley proofs. We
suggest that the following text be used to cite the accession number(s) in
publication(s): "The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper will
appear in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank Nucleotide Sequence Database under the
accession number(s) ________"

7) FORM FILLING INSTRUCTIONS
============================

<============== DO NOT EXCEED THIS LINE WIDTH IN YOUR REPLY ==============>

To display this form properly choose a fixed width font (e.g. Courier) in
your editor. If you are saving files in a word processing program then
please save the file as TEXT ONLY WITH LINE BREAKS. (To do this in
Microscoft Word you will need to choose File, Save as, Save file type as,
and select Text only with line breaks). Please do not send files that are
saved in Word or Wordperfect format. Processing of the submission may be
delayed if your email is text wrapped, encoded or binhexed.

  ########################################################################
  # Fill in the form as follows:                                         #
  # a) if there is a colon : then enter text (e.g. Last name    : Smith) #
  # b) if there is an empty box [ ] and if the answer is yes then fill   #
  #    the box with an X (e.g. Genomic DNA     [X])                      #
  # c) if the option is not relevant then do not enter any text and/or   #
  #    do not write an X in the box.                                     #
  # d) DO NOT delete lines from this form.                               #
  ########################################################################

8) ENTERING FEATURES AND LOCATIONS
==================================
Enter the feature key from the list given in Appendix I at the end of this
document. Enter the locations, gene name, product name, and EC number,
where appropriate. Use < and > in the locations to show whether the feature
is partial at the 5' end and/or the 3' end. Mark with an X in the box [ ]
if the feature is on the complementary strand and if you have experimental
evidence for the feature.

If you do not provide any features or adequate locations and names for the
features you will be contacted for more information before an accession
number is assigned to the sequence. For CDS features you must provide a gene
name AND a product name, even if the product name is putative.

If a CDS is partial at the 5' end then write the codon start number. This
is the number (1,2 or 3) of the first base of the first complete codon of
the translation. For example the following CDS is partial and the codon
start is 2 because the first complete codon, T, starts with the base a,
which is the second base in the feature.
DNA         tacatcgatg...
Translation  T  S  M...
