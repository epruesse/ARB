VALGRIND=# do not valgrind anything
#VALGRIND=A# run valgrind after sucessful test
#VALGRIND=B# run valgrind before test (useful if test traps w/o any helpful information)
#VALGRIND=E# run external tools in valgrind (must be coded; look for make_valgrinded_call())
#VALGRIND=AE# valgrind after tests and external tools
