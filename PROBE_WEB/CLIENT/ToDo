ToDo for arb_probe_library CLIENT:
==================================

- disable refresh of species list during print 

- Don't send request, if result is known to be empty
        (e.g. if node has no probes etc.)

- list of probes:
        ** sort by different criteria
        ** restrict to probes in specified temperature- and/or gccontent-range

- allow search for species by name

- tree display:
        ** change folding (use groups, autofold if display will get to high)
        ** show group names? (at least if group is folded; if open -> display left of branch)
        ** if (display width != tree width) => stretch branches
