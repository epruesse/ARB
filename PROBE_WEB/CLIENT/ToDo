ToDo for arb_probe_library CLIENT:
==================================

- list of probes:
        ** sort by different criteria
        ** restrict to probes in specified temperature- and/or gccontent-range
        ** colorize partial equally probes according to selected probe
           (or use '=' if color impossible)
        ** disable refresh during print

- allow search for species by name and by acc
        ** implementation:
        *** mark by name and by acc
        *** jump to "root-of marked"

- tree display:
        ** change folding (use groups, autofold if display will get to high)
        ** show group names? (at least if group is folded; if open -> display left of branch)
        ** if (display width != tree width) => stretch branches
        ** hotkey to jump to "root of marked"
        ** add virtual button left-upwards of root-branch: UP, [GROUP,]* ROOT
        ** add scale bar

- details:
        ** missing information:
        *** probe length
        *** % of subtree (and total # of species in subtree)

- Don't send request, if result is known to be empty
        (e.g. if node has no probes etc.)
