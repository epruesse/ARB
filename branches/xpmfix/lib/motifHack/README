motif has several problems with pixmaps (.xpm)

- motif versions (XmVersion<2003) crash if the .xpm has odd size (x and/or y)
- newer motif versions have problems reading the size of .xpm and displays
  wrong-sized buttons if the .xpm contains additional comments

This directory contains .xpm files which are automatically converted from
the original files in ../pixmaps
