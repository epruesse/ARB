ARB change log

Major changes for next release:

 - merge databases allows to
   - merge from an existing database into the database loaded in ARB_NT
   - merge to existing databases from the database loaded in ARB_NT
 - ARB_DIST
   - Detect clusters of species with similar sequences (OTUs)
   - allow automatic recalculation of matrix and/or tree whenever some parameter or
     data changes (only makes sense for smaller species sets)
 - Rewrote chimera check. Allows filtering
 - added RNACMA (computes clusters of correlated positions)
 - PT-Server
   - changed behavior
     - no longer report less hits for a part of a probe than for the probe itself (occurred at 3'-end of alignment)
     - reports previously missing hits in joined genes
     - reports more hits at 3'-end of alignment (when using mismatches the PT-server now reports possible
       matches that go beyond the end of the sequence)
     - dots in the middle of the alignment act like the sequence ends there
     - minimum probe length reduced to 2 (was 6)
     - allow up to 50% of probe to mismatch
   - performance
     - optimized memory-estimation (will build in fewer passes)
     - uses any number of passes (not only 1, 5, 25, ...)
     - allows to define used memory by setting environment variable ARB_MEMORY
     - reduced memory needed to build/run ptserver (approx. 50%)
     - reduced size of indexfile (.pt) to ~50%
     - fast startup of existing ptservers
   - probe design
     - faster in many cases
     - allow to design probes of length 8 (previously 10)
     - allow to design probes with different lengths (specifying min/max length)
     - fixed number of outgroup hits reported when decreasing temperature
       (now each outgroup member only occurs once)
     - show possible reasons why no probes could be designed
   - next relative search
     - can be restricted to column ranges (needs a PT-Server calculated from aligned sequences)
     - corrected and improved scaling of relative scores
     - more accurate scores (due to fixes in PT-Server; see below)
     - faster in many cases
   - show errors from ptserver build in ARB
 - fast-aligner
   - searches next-relatives based on selected column-block

   - macro recording works in ARB client applications (ARB_EDIT4, ARB_PARS, ARB_MERGE, ..)
   - arb_ntree can execute macro from command line
   - added "Never ask again" to modal question boxes (for better compatibility with macros)
 - load/save for window specific settings (e.g. allows to share parts of configuration with other users)
 - Support for mouse-wheel
 - many internal refactorings
