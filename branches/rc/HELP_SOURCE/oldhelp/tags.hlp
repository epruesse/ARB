TITLE		TAGS: Subfields

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT: Merge Tools / Modify Database Fields

DESCRIPTION	Tags are used to subdivide fields into subfields, which
		often have the same value. E.g. After merging the 16s databases
		from RDP and DeWachter all species have two full_names:
		The RDP and DeWachter version which should be equal but which
		are often not. So we 'TAG' the dewachter database using the
		tag 'DEW' and the RDP with the tag 'RDP'. Say one species has
		the full_names escherichia_RDP and escherichia_DEW.
		Using the tags mechanism the final field will look like this:
			' [DEW] escherichia_DEW [RDP] escherichia_RDP'.
		Tags are sourrounded by brackets and put in front of the 
		corresponding field value. If both subfields have the same 
		value, (like escherichia_coli) fields are merged:
			' [DEW,RDP] escherichia_coli'

NOTES		The Modify Database Fields tools allows to modify only single
		subfields.
		If there are no tags used yet, the default tag is taken.

			
EXAMPLES	None

BUGS		Square Brackets in the fields are replaces by '{}'
