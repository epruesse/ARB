TITLE		GROUP MODE

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT and ARB_PARSIMONY: <GROUP> button in the left column
		F3 on the keyboard

DESCRIPTION	A group is a subtree with a name assigned to its root node.
		The 'GROUP MODE' allows display of subtrees (groups of species)
		as triangles (radial tree) or rectangles (dendrogram).
		You also can convert a subtree into a group.

		Click on the <GROUP> button of the 'ARB_NT' window or
			the 'F3' key on the keyboard to activate the 'GROUP
			MODE'. In the latter case, the cursor has to be placed
			within the tree display area.

		Group species:

			Move the cursor to that internal node of the displayed
			tree (section) which defines the subtree and click on
			the left mouse button. The subtree-defining node is that
			located closest to the indicated root (open square)
			root of the whole tree which directly or indirectly connects
			all branches of the subtree.

		Ungroup species:

			Press the left mouse button while the cursor is over the triangle
			of a group.

		Transform a subtree into a group and assign a name to it:

			Proceed as described above using the right mouse
			button.
