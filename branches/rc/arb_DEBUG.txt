        Some tips for debugging ARB
        ---------------------------

- if a file named 'gb_core' exists in $(ARBHOME) then ARB dumps a core file
  (that means it will interrupt the program when called from debugger)

- Several variables/macros control how ARB performs several things:

          name                     default     default   what it does
                                   NDEBUG      DEBUG
          --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          AUTO_FLUSH               empty       empty     forces a flush after many motif drawing commands
                                                         => drawing gets visible instantly.
                                                         To activate this behavior uncomment the non-empty
                                                         version of the macro.
                                                         Normally it should be empty in DEBUG mode!
                                                         ALWAYS it should be empty in NDEBUG mode!!!

          MEMORY_TEST              0           1         activates special fast-load-file compatible memory
