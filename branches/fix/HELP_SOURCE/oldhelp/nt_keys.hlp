TITLE		ARB_NTREE keyboard reference

OCCURRENCE	Focus main area and press one of the hotkeys below

DESCRIPTION     Here's the list of keys recognized by ARB_NTREE:

                  Key   Description
                 ==========================================
                  m     mark/unmark (sub-)tree
                  i     invert marks of (sub-)tree
                  x     expand (Unmarked,All)
                  c     collapse (Terminal,All)

                If you point on a subtree while pressing one of the keys, the action is
                performed on the subtree. Otherwise (if you point somewhere outside of the tree)
                the whole tree is targeted.

                If you press < SHIFT + Key > the function works on the opposite set:

                   - Instead of the subtree, the rest of the tree is targeted.
                   - Instead of the whole tree, all species NOT in tree are targeted.

                If you press < CTRL + Key > the function works on ALL species (if it makes sense).

NOTES		Expanding/collapsing is implemented in such way, that some key-combinations lead to
                determined tree-displays.

                Examples:

                  Key-Combo   similar to
                 =================================================
                  cc          group all
                  ccx         group all except marked
                  xx          ungroup all
                  xxc         group terminal groups

                If a subtree does not contain unfolded groups the collapse keys target the first
                parent group instead.
