DESCRIPTION     AxML is an accelerated version of fastdnaML.

                - AxML produces the same results as fastdnaML does.

                - AxML is about 35%-47% faster than fastdnaML

                More information in AxML can be found at the homepage

NOTES           When adding species make sure to mark all species in tree
                before calling ML.
