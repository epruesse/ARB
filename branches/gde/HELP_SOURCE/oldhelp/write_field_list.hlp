TITLE           Write to fields of Listed

OCCURRENCE      ARB_NT/Species/Search and Query/Write to fields of Listed
                ARB_NT/Genome/Search and query/Write to fields of Listed
                ARB_NT/Genome/Experiment/Search and query/Write to fields of Listed

DESCRIPTION     Writes or appends the same value to the selected field of
                all listed species/genes.

                If the target field is not a text field, a type conversion
                takes place. If that conversion results in a different value
                than the provided one, an error will occur.
                You may allow lossy conversion by checking the switch.

NOTES           A protection level has to be selected from the Protection
                menu of the main window (ARB_NT/Protection) equal or higher
                than that assigned to the selected alignment (ARB_NT/ali_*;
                third broad rectangular button in the upper part of the
                main window).

EXAMPLES

                1. Write a date of sequence modification (03.27.95) to the
                field 'date' of all listed species (overwriting
                former entries of this field):

                        Select 'Field':   'date'
                        Type 'value':     '03.27.95'
                        Press:            'WRITE'

                2. Add the initials of the modifying person (e.g. "MP") to the
                   entries stored in the fields 'date' of all listed
                   species:

                        Select 'Field':    'date'
                        Type 'value':      'MP'
                        Press:             'APPEND'


WARNINGS        Except for the 'name' field (the identifier), there are no different protection
                levels for different fields. Take care not to write to fields
                which should contain unique entries for the corresponding
                species/genes such as accession numbers.
