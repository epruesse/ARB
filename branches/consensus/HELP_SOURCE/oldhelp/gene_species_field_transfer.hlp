TITLE		Define fields exported with gene species

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/Export/Export .. to new ARB database/Transfer Species/Source->Target/Define field transfer for gene species

DESCRIPTION     Here you can define which fields (of the origin organism or of the origin gene of
                a gene species) should be transferred to the new database and how they should be
                modified.

                To define a new transfer rule, do the following steps:

                - Enter name of created field

                - Choose a creation method

                         If you choose 'Copy from organism/gene' you have to provide a 'Source field'
                         and you MAY provide an ACI expression.

                         If you choose 'Only use ACI' you have to provide an ACI expression, but
                         no 'Source field'.

                - Check if the example shows your intended result.

NOTES		The example will be calculated for the gene-species which is selected
                in the left Hitlist of the 'TRANSFER SPECIES' window.

                The ACI expression applies to the Organism or the Gene if 'Copy from organism/gene'
                is selected. If 'Only use ACI' is selected it applies to the gene-species.

                Note that it is possible to create hierarchical keys. Simply enter something like
                'organism/full_name' into the destination field.

EXAMPLES	None

WARNINGS	None

BUGS		When you export gene-species to a new database this database is marked as 'Arb-Genome-Database'.
                We need to implement some kind of Database-Admin-Tool to change the database type.
