TITLE		Probe match (Expert)

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/Probes/Match Probes/EXPERT

DESCRIPTION     See LINK{bonds.hlp} for upper area.

                Define how many N-matches are accepted:

                       'Accepted N-matches' defines the amount of N-matches that
                       are accepted wothout causing a mismatch.

                       'N-match limit' defines an upper limit for N-matches. Whenever
                       that limit is reached inside one probe, all N-matches count as
                       mismatches.

                Define max. results:

                       The number of hits is limited to 1 million by default.

                       This is just there to protect you from waiting several
                       hours for match results, just because your settings were
                       too lax.

                       Changing it to 0 disables the limitation.

NOTES		An N-Match is caused either by Ns in the matched probe or
                by Ns in the hit target region.

EXAMPLES	None

WARNINGS	Specifying high values for N-matches and then matching a probe containing
                many Ns, may keep your machine busy for days. Use with care.

BUGS		No bugs known
