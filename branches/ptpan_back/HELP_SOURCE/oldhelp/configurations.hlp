DESCRIPTION     This provides a general way to store and restore settings
                from the window, where this has been called from.

                - STORE: stores current settings into properties.
                - RESTORE: restores settings from properties.
                - DELETE: delete stored settings from properties

                - LOAD: load settings from a file, STORE and RESTORE

NOTES		To save stored settings permanently, use SAVE PROPERTIES!
