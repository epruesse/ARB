PTPan standalone library
(latest changes: 20 November 2011)

PTPan standalone library has some dependencies on other projects listed below.


REQUIRED:
    - boost (1.40 or later)
    
OPTIONAL:
    - hwloc (highly recommended)
    
    
If hwloc is not used, detection of CPU cores to use will fall back
to the solution provided by boost::thread which currently takes into
account SMT/Hyperthreading as well. This may lead to a decreased performance.
