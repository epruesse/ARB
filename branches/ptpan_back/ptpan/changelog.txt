PTPan ARB integration

v0.6.5 (?? ?? 2011)

- TODO

- parallelized build process in shared memory
- parallelized creation of differential alignment
- various code optimizations (e.g. removed some C-style stuff)
- optimized partition determination process (choose best thread count)
- addec memory utilization ratio parameter (use at own risk)
- optimized long edge dictionary build process to take less time
  and build time memory in trade of a little bit of space in 
  the final index

- added genome support (features)
- added getAllProbes(length) method
- added method probeNongroupIncreaseWMis()
- optimizing ProbeDesign (query independent of 
  core structures -> removed pe_IsGroup flag)
- ProbeDesgin can now cope with selected features (aka feature-ProbeDesign)
  in addition to whole genome ProbeDesign
- added method probeNongroupIncreaseArrayWidth()
- added custom information field in index header

- major refactoring to make interface easier to use
  WARNING The new interface is not compatible to the old one!

- BUGFIX fixed a rare occurring error in long edge dictionary build

v0.5.2 (31 August 2011)

- fixed minor issue in tree build

v0.5.1 (09 July 2011)

- fixed minor issue in ARB integration: ProbeDesign parameter output fixed
- fixed rare occurring error in probeMatch leading to program abortion

v0.5.0 (09 May 2011)

- initial release
