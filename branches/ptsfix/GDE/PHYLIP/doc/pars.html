<P>
PARS is a general parsimony program which carries out the Wagner
parsimony method with multiple states.  Wagner parsimony
allows changes among all states.  The criterion is to find the tree which
requires the minimum number of changes.
The Wagner method was originated by Eck and Dayhoff (1966) and by Kluge and
Farris (1969).  Here are its assumptions:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Ancestral states are unknown unknown.
<LI>Different characters evolve independently.
<LI>Different lineages evolve independently.
<LI>Changes to all other states are equally probable (Wagner).
<LI>These changes are a priori improbable over the
evolutionary time spans involved in the differentiation of the
group in question.
<LI>Other kinds of evolutionary event such as retention of polymorphism
are far less probable than these state changes.
<LI>Rates of evolution in different lineages are sufficiently low that
two changes in a long segment of the tree are far less probable
than one change in a short segment.
</OL>
<P>
That these are the assumptions of parsimony methods has been documented
in a series of papers of mine: (1973a, 1978b, 1979, 1981b,
1983b, 1988b).  For an opposing view arguing that the parsimony methods
make no substantive 
assumptions such as these, see the papers by Farris (1983) and Sober (1983a, 
1983b), but also read the exchange between Felsenstein and Sober (1986).  
<P>
<H2>INPUT FORMAT</H2>
<P>
The input for PARS is the standard input for discrete characters
programs, described above in the documentation file for the
discrete-characters programs, except that multiple states (up to 9 of them)
are allowed.  Any characters other than "?" are allowed as states, up to a
maximum of 9 states.  In fact, one can
use different symbols in different columns of the data matrix,
although it is rather unlikely that you would want to do that.
The symbols you can use are:
<UL>
<LI>The digits <TT>0-9</TT>,
<LI>The letters <TT>A-Z</TT> and <TT>a-z</TT>,
<LI>The symbols <TT>"!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@\[\\]^_`\{|}~</TT><BR>
    (of these, probably only + and - will be of interest to most users).
</UL>
But note that these do <I>not</I> include blank (" ").  Blanks in the
input data are simply skipped by the program, so that they can be used to
make characters into groups for ease of viewing.
The "?" (question mark) symbol has special meaning.  It is allowed in the
input but is not available as the symbol of a state.  Rather, it means that
the state is unknown.
<P>
PARS can handle both bifurcating and multifurcating trees.  In doing its
search for most parsimonious trees, it adds species not only by creating new
forks in the middle of existing branches, but it also tries putting them at
the end of new branches which are added to existing forks.  Thus it searches
among both bifurcating and multifurcating trees.  If a branch in a tree
does not have any characters which might change in that branch in the most
parsimonious tree, it does not save that tree.  Thus in any tree that
results, a branch exists only if some character has a most parsimonious
reconstruction that would involve change in that branch.
<P>
It also saves a number of trees tied for best (you can alter the number
it saves using the V option in the menu).  When rearranging trees, it
tries rearrangements of all of the saved trees.  This makes the algorithm
slower than earlier programs such as MIX.
<P>
The options are selected using a menu:

<P>
The Weights (W) option
takes the weights from a file whose default name is "weights".  The weights
follow the format described in the main documentation file, with integer
weights from 0 to 35 allowed by using the characters 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 and
A, B, ... Z.
<P>
The User tree (option U) is read from a file whose default name is
<TT>intree</TT>.
The trees can be multifurcating. They must be preceded in the file by a
line giving the number of trees in the file.
<P>
The options J, O, T, and M are the usual Jumble, Outgroup,
Threshold parsimony, and Multiple Data Sets options,
described either
in the main documentation file or in the Discrete Characters Programs
documentation file.
<P>
The M (multiple data sets option) will ask you whether you want to
use multiple sets of weights (from the weights file) or multiple data sets.
The ability to use a single data set with multiple weights means that
much less disk space will be used for this input data.  The bootstrapping
and jackknifing tool Seqboot has the ability to create a weights file with
multiple weights.
<P>
The O (outgroup) option will have no effect if the U (user-defined tree)
option is in effect.
The T (threshold) option allows a continuum of methods
between parsimony and compatibility.  Thresholds less than or equal to 1.0 do
not have any meaning and should
not be used: they will result in a tree dependent only on the input
order of species and not at all on the data!
<P>
<H2>OUTPUT FORMAT</H2>
<P>
Output is standard: if option 1 is toggled on, the data is printed out,
with the convention that "." means "the same as in the first species".
Then comes a list of equally parsimonious trees.
Each tree has branch lengths.  These are computed using an algorithm
published by Hochbaum and Pathria (1997) which I first heard of from
Wayne Maddison who invented it independently of them.  This algorithm
averages the number of reconstructed changes of state over all sites a
over all possible most parsimonious placements of the changes of state
among branches.  Note that it does not correct in any way for multiple
changes that overlay each other.
<P>
If option 2 is
toggled on a table of the 
number of changes of state required in each character is also
printed.  If option 5 is toggled
on, a table is printed
out after each tree, showing for each  branch whether there are known to be
changes in the branch, and what the states are inferred to have been at the
top end of the branch.  This is a reconstruction of the ancestral sequences
in the tree.  If you choose option 5, a menu item D appears which gives you
the opportunity to turn off dot-differencing so that complete ancestral
sequences are shown.  If the inferred state is a "?",
there will be multiple
equally-parsimonious assignments of states; the user must work these out for
themselves by hand.
If option 6 is left in its default state the trees
found will be written to a tree file, so that they are available to be used
in other programs.
<P>
If the U (User Tree) option is used and more than one tree is supplied, the
program also performs a statistical test of each of these trees against the
best tree.  This test, which is a version of the test proposed by
Alan Templeton (1983) and evaluated in a test case by me (1985a).  It is
closely parallel to a test using log likelihood differences
due to Kishino and Hasegawa (1989), and
uses the mean and variance of
step differences between trees, taken across sites.  If the mean
is more than 1.96 standard deviations different then the trees are declared
significantly different.  The program
prints out a table of the steps for each tree, the differences of
each from the best one, the variance of that quantity as determined by
the step differences at individual sites, and a conclusion as to
whether that tree is or is not significantly worse than the best one.
It is important to understand that the test assumes that all the discrete
characters are evolving independently, which is unlikely to be true for
many suites of morphological characters.
<P>
Option 6 in the menu controls whether the tree estimated by the program
is written onto a tree file.  The default name of this output tree file
is "outtree".  If the U option is in effect, all the user-defined
trees are written to the output tree file.
