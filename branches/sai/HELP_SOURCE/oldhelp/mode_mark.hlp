TITLE		MARK MODE

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT <MARK> button (second button of the left column)>
		F2 on the keyboard

DESCRIPTION	The 'MARK MODE' allows you to mark and unmark individual species, or all
		species of a subtree.

		Click on the <MARK> button (first button in the left column) of
			the 'ARB_NT' window or the 'F2' key on the keyboard to
			activate the 'MARK MODE'. In the latter case, the cursor
			has to be placed within the tree display area.

		Mark single species:

			Move the cursor to any terminal branch or the left part
			of the information displayed at the terminal node and
			press the left mouse button.

		Mark all species of a subtree:

			Move the cursor to any position along the edge defining
			the subtree and proceed as described above.

			The subtree-defining branch is that located closest to
			the indicated root (open square) of the whole tree
			directly or indirectly connected to all branches of the
			subtree.


NOTES		The marked species are indicated by filled squares at the
		terminal nodes.

		Short descriptions of the 'MODE' and the functions assigned
		to the mouse buttons are given in the fourth line of the
		'ARB_NT' window.

		The middle mouse button (placed anywhere within the tree
		display area) can be used to move the whole tree.
