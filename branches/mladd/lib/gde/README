This directory contains GDE-style menu files.

  These files are copies of the original files or generated:

        arb.menu        main GDE menu
                        generated by ../../GDEHELP/Makefile@all

        Others were copied directly by their associated Makefiles:
                ../../GDE/RAxML8/Makefile
                ../../GDE/SATIVA/Makefile

Menu names:

  The names used/usable for menus are hardcoded in C++ code of NTREE/EDIT4
  (see GDE_load_menu). If a menu-name is unknown, the items placed there
  simply do not show up anywhere.

  Menus may be used from multiple applications => entries show up in each
  application. Currently this is true only for the 'Print' menu, which is
  included in ARB_NTREE and ARB_EDIT4.
