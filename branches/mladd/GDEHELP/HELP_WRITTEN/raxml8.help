RAxML 8 (DNA)

DESCRIPTION

        RAxML (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) is a program for sequential and parallel Maximum
        Likelihood-based inference of large phylogenetic trees.

        It has originally been derived from fastDNAml which
        in turn was derived from Joe Felsenteins dnaml which is part of the PHYLIP package.

PARAMETERS

        Only the parameters adjustable via the ARB interface are described below. For in-depth
        documentation please refer to original documentation.

          Protocol

            The following protocols are defined in ARB RAxML8 interface:

              Thorough

                1. perform multiple searches for the best ML tree
                2. perform multiple bootstrap searches (executed parallel to 1. if enough CPU cores available)
                3. draw bipartition information (from 2.) on best tree found in 1.

              Quick

                Rapid bootstrap analysis and search for best-scoring ML tree in one program run.

          Model

            The following substitution models are provided in ARB RAxML8 interface:

                GTRCAT

                  GTR + Optimization of substitution rates + Optimization of
                  site-specific evolutionary rates which are categorized into
                  numberOfCategories distinct rate categories for greater
                  computational efficiency.

                GTRGAMMA

                  GTR + Optimization of substitution rates + GAMMA model of
                  rate heterogeneity (alpha parameter will be estimated). 

          Searches

            Specifies the number of searches for best ML tree that will be
            performed in step 1. of 'Thorough' protocol.

          Bootstraps

            Specifies the number of bootstraps runs to perform.

          Tree name

            Suffix for result trees loaded into ARB, e.g.:

                'raxml' => 'tree_raxml' (and optionally 'tree_raxml_mre')
            

          Compute MRE consensus tree

                Compute extended majority rule consensus tree.

          Random seed

                Specifies a fixed random seed (used for parsimony inferences AND rapid bootstrapping).
                This only makes sense if you like to reproduce results (which isn't possible for all cases).

                Recommended default setting is (empty). The number of seconds
                since 'epoch' will be used in that case.

          CPU thread override

                Specify number of threads to use.

                If not specified, the number of available CPU cores is detected and the number
                of recommended threads is calculated from the number of alignment sites.
                If enough cores are available, the ML search and the bootstrapping are performed
                in parallel.

                If autodetection works, you should NOT specify the number of threads! Doing so
                will disable parallel execution of bootstrapping and ML search.
                Also specifying too many threads (ie. more than cores available) will slow down
                RAxML.

                The number of assumed/used CPU cores may be overridden using
                the environment variable PBS_NP.
