TITLE           SPECIES INFORMATION

OCCURRENCE      ARB_NT/<INFO> button: left area, fifth from top
                ARB_NT/Species/Info
                ARB_NT/Species/Search

DESCRIPTION     Displays species information stored within the 'fields' (see
                LINK{glossary.hlp}).

                The particular 'species' (see LINK{glossary.hlp})
                can be 'marked' or 'unmarked' (see LINK{glossary.hlp})
                by pressing the checkbox after the 'Marked?' prompt.

                Editing of 'field' entries is enabled or prevented by
                pressing the 'Edit enabled?' checkbox.

                The entries of a 'field' are modified by choosing it from
                the 'DATABASE FIELDS' subwindow and modifying the entries
                displayed in the 'Edit box' subwindow.

NOTES           The 'SEARCH & QUERY' window can be displayed by pressing the <SEARCH>
                button.

                For modification of 'field' entries, a protection level
                has to be selected from the Protection menu of the main
                window (ARB_NT/Protection) equal to or higher than that
                assigned to the selected 'field'

                Cut and paste of the window system can be used in the 'Edit
                box' subwindow. This provides is an easy way to export/import
                sequences.
                Use the left mouse button to mark (cut is done automatically).
                Then use the middle mouse button to paste.

                When you open this window it will always show the information of
                the current species. That means if you select another species (in ARB_NT or in the editor)
                this window will follow and display information of the selected species.
                After clicking on the <DETACH> button once the window will no longer follow the current
                species automatically. You may open a new information window then (which will follow again).
                Clicking again on the <DETACH> button will catch up the detached window to the current species.

SECTION         STANDARD ENTRIES

                The following database entries have a special meaning in ARB:

                name            unique species ID (generated by ARB)
                full_name       full species name (generated by the user)
                acc             Accession number (automatically generated by ARB if missing)

                Entries relevant for DNA->AminoAcid encoding:

                codon_start     contains the base inside the gene at which the
                                first codon starts (valid: 1,2,3)
                                if this entry is missing 1 is assumed
                transl_table    the number of the translation table to be used
                                (1 = Standard, ...)

                Commonly used database entries (e.g. by import/export):
