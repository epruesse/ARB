TITLE		Export File Formats

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/File/Export Foreign Format

DESCRIPTION	The export format description file (*.eft) describes
		the format.
		It contains different sections:

	SECTIONS

		SUFFIX		suffix		;The suggested file suffix
		#		headerinfo	;Header information
		BEGIN ...			;the main section

		The main section is part of a 'SRT' (see LINK{srt.hlp})
		conversion (in fact the main section S is replaced by "*=S" and
		the SRT is started on an empty string).
		That means:

			1. All simple 'text' is written to the output file.

			2. All references '*([ref][:|#modifier])' are replaced
                           by the [modified] value of the reference

			3. All lines containing the word '$$DELETE_LINE$$' are deleted.

                        4. Lines ending with a \ are joined with the next line.

	SPECIAL	SECTIONS

		PRE_FORMAT xxx.eft

		SYSTEM "command"

				First a output is created using
				xxx.eft. Then command is used to convert the
				result into the wanted result.

				In command use

					$< as input-filename

					$> as output-filename

		INTERNAL type

				used for formats hardcoded in ARB_NT.

				Supported types:

                                          'xml_write' Writes all none-hidden fields to XML.

NOTES		The best ways to design new formats are:

			1. Copy an existing format and modify it step by step.
			2. Design a simple format and modify it step by step.

EXAMPLES	Edit the files in '$ARBHOME/lib/export'

WARNINGS	Don't change an '*.eft' file, if you don't understand how
		it works.
		Be careful when using ':' or '"' symbols.
		Escape them if those symbols don't have a meaning.

BUGS		No bugs known
