TITLE		Search for equal fields

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/Search/More search/Search for equal fields and mark duplicates
                ARB_NT/Search/More search/Search for equal words between fields and mark duplicates

DESCRIPTION     Searches groups of species containing
                         * the same value or
                         * identical words in values
                in the field selected at 'Search field' of the first query.

                All duplicated occurrences are added to the hitlist - first occurrence gets '1st' added,
                following occurrences get 'dup' added.

                The first occurrence is NOT marked, all following occurrences get marked - so you can easily
                perform some action on duplicates.

NOTES		If you select 'that don't match the query' in the search window,
                this function instead searches for unique entries!

EXAMPLES	None
