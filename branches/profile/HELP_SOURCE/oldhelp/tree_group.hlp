TITLE           Collapse/expand tree

OCCURRENCE      ARB_NT/Tree/Collapse expand tree

DESCRIPTION     The items in this menu allow to control which
                groups (groups of species; see LINK{mode_group.hlp})
                shall be collapsed and which shall be expanded.

                Collapsed groups are displayed as triangles (or rectangles
                in IRS tree; see LINK{tr_type_irs.hlp}).

                Different ways to collapse/expand:

                 * Collapse all: collapses all groups (and subgroups)
                 * Collapse terminal: collapses terminal groups, expands other groups
                 * Expand all: expands all groups (and subgroups)
                 * Expand marked: expands all groups that contain marked species, collapses other groups
                 * Expand zombies: expands all groups that contain zombies (see LINK{glossary.hlp}), collapses other groups
                 * Expand color: expands all groups that contain species in specific, any or no color

NOTES           The lengths of the triangle sides reflect the longest and shortest overall
                branch lengths within the subtree.

                To collapse/expand via keyboard, see LINK{nt_keys.hlp}.
