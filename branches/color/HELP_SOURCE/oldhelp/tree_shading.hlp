TITLE		Tree shading

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/Tree/Tree shading...

DESCRIPTION     Allows to select if and how to shade the tree.

                In the 'Overlay' section you can define whether to overlay the
                tree shading with
                 - group colors and/or
                 - marked color.
                The selection is shader-specific and will override global settings.
