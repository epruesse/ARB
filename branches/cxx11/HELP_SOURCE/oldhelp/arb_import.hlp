TITLE		Import Foreign Data(bases)

OCCURRENCE	ARB_INTRO <Create and Import>,
                ARB_NT/File/Import/Import sequences and fields (ARB)

DESCRIPTION	Reads foreign data(base) formats, creates a new ARB database,
		and imports the foreign data. A selection of commonly used
		foreign formats can be automatically identified. Data can be
		imported from single or multiple files.

		Type a source file name to the 'Enter file name of foreign
                database' subwindow. Use * and ? as multiple and single
                character wild carts to load a set of files, respectively.
                Alternatively you may select a file from the directories and
                files subwindow.

                Make a selection whether you want to import

                     - a full genome flatfile (in GENBANK or EMBL format) or
                     - normal sequence files.

		In the second case select the file format from the
                'Select foreign database format' subwindow
                or press the 'AUTO DETECT' button.

		If your file type is not in the list and you are only
                interested in the sequence, try 'universal'.

		Enter an 'alignment' name. This allows you to distinguish between
                different alignments in the same datebase later.

		Press the 'GO' button.

NOTES		Following file formats currently can be detected and loaded:
		GENBANK, RDP: GENBANK and AE2, GCG used by GENIUS, FastA, DSSP.

		To import big new databases into an existing ARB database, convert it
		to the ARB format first, save and merge it with the
		'ARB_INTRO <MERGE TWO ARB DATABASES>' tool.

		For importing other formats such as PHYLIP or PAUP into an
		existing ARB database use the 'Import sequences using Readseq'
                function accessible via the 'File' menu of the 'ARB_NT' main menu.
                See LINK{agde_readseq.hlp}.

		If 'AUTO DETECT' does not find any format, selecting a format
		by hand most likely wont help you (exception: universal format).

WARNINGS	When using 'AUTO DETECT', check if the correct format is detected.
		RDP files may for instance be identified as GenBank. In such case
		choose 'rdp.ift' manually.

BUGS		'AUTO DETECT' looks for certain key-words in the files. If it can't
		find these words, it does not accept the file, even if the file has
                the correct format. This is especially true for the gcg format.
