HOWTO release ARB
=================

Overview:

1. 'trunk' versioning
2. Create initial release candidate (rc1)
3. Create subsequent release candidates (rc2,..)
4. Create release
5. Hotfixes for release

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. 'trunk' versioning

        'trunk' shall always contain the release version number planned for the NEXT release.
        Example1:
                last release was arb-5.5
                trunk should already contain arb-5.6 (or arb-6.0, whatever is planned)

        Example2:
                last release was arb-5.5
                last rc was arb-6.0-rc1
                trunk should already contain arb-6.1

        Intention is to have a explicit feature freeze whenever a rc is branched.

        To increment the version number,
        - change into trunk WC
        - svn update
        - make inc_minor or inc_major
        - in ../../arb_CHANGES.txt
          - add missing changes
          - update version info
        - commit changes


2. Create initial release candidate (rc1)

        - change into trunk WC and update to revision wanted for rc
        - make sure the version number in trunk is already correct (see 1.)
          To show it call
                make show_version
        - make sure arb_CHANGES.txt is up-to-date (i.e. lists changes for version-to-release)
        - to make sure you are at HEAD call
                svn update
        - to branch the rc1 call
                SOURCE_TOOLS/release/release_tool.pl branch_rc1


3. Create subsequent release candidates (rc2,..)

        Note: Subsequent release candidates are meant for bugfixes only!

        - change into 'rc' WC
        - to increment rc number call
                make inc_candi
        - merge all bugfixes from trunk (or apply them in branch 'rc' and merge them back to trunk)
        - commit changes and let a jenkins build pass (job 'ARB-rc'; builds automatically)
        - to make sure you are at HEAD call
                svn update
        - call
                SOURCE_TOOLS/release/release_tool.pl tag_rc


4. Create release

        Note: Release should be a copy at the latest rc

        - change into 'rc' WC
        - to make sure you are at HEAD call
                svn update
        - to branch the release call
                SOURCE_TOOLS/release/release_tool.pl branch_stable


5. Hotfixes for release

        - change into 'stable' WC
        - to increment the release patchlevel call
                make inc_patch
        - merge all hotfixes from trunk (or apply them in branch 'stable' and merge them back to trunk)
        - commit changes and let a jenkins build pass (job 'ARB-stable'; builds automatically)
        - to make sure you are at HEAD call
                svn update
        - call
                SOURCE_TOOLS/release/release_tool.pl tag_stable
