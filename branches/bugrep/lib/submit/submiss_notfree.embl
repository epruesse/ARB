                       SEQUENCE DATA SUBMISSION FORM


This form solicits the information needed for a  nucleotide  or  amino  acid
sequence  database  entry.   It  can  be  filled in using any text editor or
printed and filled in by  hand.   By  completing  and  returning  it  to  us
promptly  you  help  us  to  enter  your data in the database accurately and
rapidly.  These data will be shared among  the  following  databases:   EMBL
Data Library (Heidelberg, W.  Germany); GenBank (Los Alamos, NM, U.S.A.  and
Mountain View, CA, U.S.A), DNA Data Bank  of  Japan  (DDBJ;  Tokyo,  Japan);
National  Biomedical  Research  Foundation  Protein  Identification Resource
(NBRF-PIR; Washington, D.C.,  U.S.A.);  Martinsried  Institute  for  Protein
Sequence  Data  (MIPS;  Martinsried,  W.  Germany) and International Protein
Information Database in Japan (JIPID; Tokyo).

Please answer all questions which apply to your data.  If you  submit  2  or
more  non-contiguous  sequences,  copy  and  fill  out  this  form  for each
additional sequence.  When  submitting  nucleic  acid  sequences  containing
protein  coding  regions,  please include a translation (SEPARATELY from the
nucleic acid sequence).  Then send us (1) this form, (2) a pre-  or  reprint
of  any manuscript which pertains to these data, and (3) your sequence data.
You can send these materials (a) electronically via computer network, (b) on
magnetic tape, or (c) on a floppy diskette.  More detailed information about
formats for submitted data is included at the end of this form.

  our mailing address:     EMBL Data Library Submissions, Postfach 10.2209
                           D-6900 Heidelberg,  West Germany
  telephone:               (06221) 387 258
  computer network:        datasubs@embl.earn (for data submissions)
                           datalib@embl.earn  (for general inquiries)

Please include in your submission any additional sequence data which is  not
reported  in  your  manuscript  but  which has been reliably determined (for
example, introns or flanking sequences).

When we receive this material we will assign the data an  accession  number,
which  serves  as  a  reference  that  permanently  identifies  them  in the
database.  We will inform you what accession  number  your  data  have  been
given  and  we  recommend  that you cite this number when referring to these
data in publications.

If new data become available  which  would  make  the  database  entry  more
informative  (e.g.,  function  of  the gene product or location of important
sites within the sequence), or if you discover errors in  the  sequence,  we
urge you to contact us so that we can update your entry.

Thank you.

IV.  FEATURES OF THE SEQUENCE

Please  list  below  the  types  and  locations of all significant  features
experimentally  identified within the sequence.   Be sure that your sequence
is numbered beginning with "1."

In the column marked                   fill in

      feature          type of feature (see information below)
      from             number of first base/amino acid in the feature
      to               number of last base/amino acid in the feature
      bp               x, if numbering  refers to position of a base pair in
                       a nucleotide sequence
      aa               x, if numbering  refers to  position of an amino acid
                       residue in a peptide sequence
      id               indicate  method by which the feature was identified.
                       E  =  experimentally;  S  =  by similarity  to  known
                       sequence or to an established consensus sequence; P =
                       by similarity  to  some  other  pattern,  such  as an
                       open reading frame
      comp             x, if feature is  located on the  nucleic acid strand
                       complementary to that reported here

Significant features include:

  -  regulatory signals (e.g., promoters, attenuators, enhancers)
  -  transcribed  regions  (e.g., mRNA, rRNA, tRNA).  (indicate reading frame
     if start and stop codons are not present)
  -  regions  subject to  post-transcriptional  modificaton  (e.g.,  introns,
     modified bases)
  -  translated regions
  -  extent of  signal  peptide,  prepropeptide,  propeptide,  mature peptide
  -  regions subject to post-translational modification  (e.g.,  glycosylated
     or phosphorylated sites)
  -  other  domains/sites  of  interest  (e.g.,  extracellular  domain,  DNA-
     binding domain, active site, inhibitory site)
  -  sites involved in bonding (disulfide, thiolester, intrachain, interchain)
  -  regions of protein secondary structure  (e.g., alpha helix or beta sheet)
  -  conflicts with sequence data reported by other authors
  -  variations and polymorphisms

The first 2 lines of the table are filled in with examples.

FORMATS FOR SUBMITTED DATA

We are happy to accept data submitted in any of the following formats:

(1) Electronic file transfer:  files can be sent via  computer  network  to:
DATASUBS@EMBL.EARN.   This  BITNET/EARN  address  can be reached via various
gateways from Arpanet, Usenet, JANET, etc.  Ask your  local  network  expert
for help or phone us.

(2) Magnetic tapes:  9-track only  (fixed-length  records  preferred);  800,
1600 or 6250 bpi (any blocksize); ASCII or EBCDIC character codes; any label
type or unlabelled.

(3) Floppy disks:  we can read Macintosh diskettes and 5-1/4" diskettes from
MS-DOS systems.

Whatever format you choose, we would appreciate receiving the sequence  data
in a form which  conforms as closely as possible to the  following standards.

  -  Each sequence should include the names of the authors.

  -  Each distinct sequence should be listed separately using the same number 
     of  bases/residues  per  line.   The  length of each  sequence in bases/
     residues should be clearly indicated. 

  -  Enumeration should begin with a "1" and continue in the  direction 5' to
     3' (or amino- to carboxy-terminus). 

  -  Amino acid sequences should be listed using the one-letter code.

  -  Translations of protein  coding  regions in  nucleotide sequences should
     be submitted in a  separate computer file from the  nucleotide sequences
     themselves. 

  -  The code for representing the sequence  characters should conform to the
     IUPAC-IUB standards, which are described in:  Nucl. Acids Res. 13: 3021-
     3030  (1985)  (for  nucleic  acids)  and  J. Biol. Chem. 243:  3557-3559 
     (1968) and Eur. J. Biochem 5: 151-153 (1968) (for amino acids).
