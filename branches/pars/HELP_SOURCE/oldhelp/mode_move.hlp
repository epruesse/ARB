TITLE		MOVE MODE

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT and ARB_PARSIMONY: <MOVE> button in the left column
# @@@ do not mention F10 (normally blocked by WM)

DESCRIPTION	The 'MOVE MODE' allows to change the topology of the
		displayed tree by moving subtrees.

		Click on the <MOVE> button in the left column of
                the main window.

		Move subtree:

                     Drag and drop a branch onto a target branch, to remove the branch
                     from the tree and insert it next to the target branch.

		Move Group Info:

                     Use the right mouse button to move the group information only.
                     When dropped onto another group, both group informations will be
                     exchanged.

SECTION         ARB_PARSIMONY specific

		Within the 'ARB_PARSIMONY' window, this mode can be used to test
		tree topologies with respect to maximum parsimony criteria by
		moving subtrees. The current parsimony value is shown after the
		'Current Par' prompt and can be compared with the 'Optimum Par'
		value of the initial tree.


NOTES		None

EXAMPLES	None

WARNINGS        It is recommended to copy the tree before using the 'MOVE MODE',
                to avoid problems caused by that bug:

BUGS		Undo 'Move Group Info' does not work (leads to loss of groupname).
