ARB change log

Major changes for next release:

 - ARB PARSIMONY
   * topology optimization
     - now (by default) strictly restricted to marked/visible parts of the tree (#640)
     - restriction now customizable (marked/all; visible/all)
     - tree costs for protein-data were not independent from root-position (as expected by model; #633).
       Caused infinite running optimization under some circumstances.
     - optimize-modes now strictly restrict to clicked subtrees. single/repeated optimization possible.
     - KL-optimizer
       * static path reduction slightly changed meaning. changed default settings.
       * removed randomness (was just covering some bugs)
       * improved general optimization speed
   * branchlength calculation
     - "forgot" to recalculate lengths under some conditions. fixed.
     - is now independent of tree-root position (#641)
   * adding species
     - 'add partial species' failed if two partial species had NO overlap (#609). fixed.
     - in 'add species + NNI' local optimization quality depended on insert position. fixed.
   * generally reduced the number of performed combines (skipping many useless)
   * added function to randomize (parts of) the tree
   * warns about insufficient sequence data (e.g. as result of too restrictive filtering; #631)
   * fixed 'RESTORE' (crashed after deleting species from tree; #528)
   * corrected handling of dots ('.') while combining anchestor sequences
   * fixed a bunch of internal bugs (#620, #627, ...)
   * added species-info
 - DNA realigner
   * several unjustified failures will no longer happen (fixes #419 and most likely #145)
     - correctly re-syncs after 'X' (if possible at all)
     - no longer fails for 'B' and 'Z'
     - accepts 3 or more consecutive IUPAC codes in DNA
   * added option to cut-off DNA sequence (was done at end of sequence by old version. fixed)
   * fixed several minor bugs
 - ARB probeSpec: visualisation of probe set specificity (thanks to Paavo Jumppanen, CSIRO)
 - species selections (editor configurations):
   * visualisation of multiple selections in standard tree view (#658; example in database demo.arb)
   * order can be changed; each configuration has a comment; import stores configuration (#607)
 - support for extra database compression (using gzip, bzip2, xz); databases cannot be opened by arb versions before 6.1.x
 - ARB_EDIT4:
   * allow to load missing SAIs
   * "view differences" to a reference sequence:
      - customizable:
        * char used for "equality" (i.e. what is displayed where a sequence is equal to selected sequence)
        * case-sensitivity
        * ignore different gap-types
      - equal data also gets hidden in consensus
      - refresh differences of all displayed sequences, when data of selected sequences changes
      - change reference sequence using CTRL-R or automatically let it follow the cursor
      - added hotkey to toggle mode: CTRL-D
      - fixed minor bugs
   * consensus calculation in ARB_EDIT4 and calculation of CONSENSUS SAI
     - now both calculations are strictly consistent:
       * gaps are now ignored while deciding whether to simplify using IUPAC ambiguity codes
       * IUPAC ambiguity codes encountered in sequence data are now counted proportionally (=> fewer 'N's occur in consensus)
     - added sliders to consensus definition windows
     - user defined consensus settings exchangable between both consensus setups
     - fixed and updated documentation
   * added species-info + database save
 - SAI: MAX_FREQUENCY
   * considers IUPAC ambiguity codes proportionally
   * amino acids: if MAX_FREQUENCY is below 10% SAI now shows '1' (prev. it did show '0', i.e. 100%)
 - expand zombies in tree (unfold groups)
 - compare taxonomy (and mark differences; #651)
 - external (command line) aligners:
   * fixed incorrect handling of 'T' vs 'U': now all aligned sequences will contain the correct base depending on alignment type
   * preserve gap-type ('-' vs '.') and upper-/lower-case of original alignment
   * no longer ask what to do with aligned sequence, just overwrite it
     - only warn about real sequence changes (so please do NOT ignore from now on!)
 - config-managers:
   * possibility to restore factory defaults
   * added comment field for configurations
   * added them throughout arb (#647)
 - added slide controls throughout arb (#656)
 - colorsets were invalidated by generating new IDs (#660). fixed.
 - updated/added external tools:
   - added alternate RAxML (DNA only; version 8.0.26)
 - updated integrated documentation
