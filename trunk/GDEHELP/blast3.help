     blast3 database query [E=#] [S=#] [T=#] [X=#] [W=#] [M=subfile] [Y=#] [Z=#]
                         [F=#] [L=#] [R=#] [N=#] [U=#] [K=#] [L=#]
                         [H=#] [V=#] [B=#] [D=#]

DESCRIPTION
     BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is  the  heuristic
     search  algorithm employed by the program blast3.  This pro-
     gram is used to compare an amino acid query sequence against
     a protein sequence database.  The principal use of this pro-
     gram is  to  identify  statistically  significant  three-way
     sequence  alignments  in which the component pairwise align-
     ments are statistically _i_nsignificant.

     The output from this program may be of four different types.
     The  first type of output consists of statistically signifi-
     cant High-scoring Segment Pairs (HSP), where a _s_e_g_m_e_n_t is an
     arbitrarily  long  run  of contiguous residues.  An HSP is a
     pair of segments, one from the query sequence and one from a
     database  sequence, where the score of their ungapped align-
     ment meets or exceeds a parametrized cutoff value.  A set of
     zero  or more HSPs is thus defined by two sequences, a scor-
     ing scheme, and a cutoff score.  Depending on the parameters
     used, there is a non-zero probability of missing one or more
     HSPs.

     The second type of output consists of a one-line description
     for each diagonal on which at least one HSP was found.  This
     list accounts for all diagonals--those due to HSPs that  are
     statistically  significant,  as  well as those that are sta-
     tistically _i_nsignificant.

     The third type of  output  consists  of  a  summary  of  the
     three-way  alignments,  which  contain  one segment from the
     query sequence and two from the database.  A given  HSP  may
     occur  at most once in this list, represented by the highest
     scoring three-way alignment in which  it  participates  that
     has  greater  statistical  significance than any of its com-
     ponent pairwise alignments.

     The fourth type of output consists of  individual  three-way
     alignments   with   scores   greater  than  or  equal  to  a
     parametrized cutoff value.

PARAMETERS
     Parameters are modified using  a  _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e  syntax,  _e._g.,
     S=100.

     S is the cutoff score for recording HSPs.  Unless explicitly
     specified  on  the  command line, the cutoff score is deter-
     mined by the setting of E, which  is  an  estimate  for  the
     number  of  HSPs  found  in the search of a random database.
     For a fixed value of E (_e._g., the default value of 1000) and
     a  given  query  sequence, the calculated value of S will be
     different when searching databases of different lengths.

     When calculated automatically, S  is  rounded  down  to  the
     nearest integer.

     W is the word size for  finding  initial  _h_i_t_s  against  the
     database.   These hits are extended in both directions along
     the diagonal until the segment score drops off by the  quan-
     tity  X  (see  below).  The default W is 4 amino acids.  The
     value of W should not be changed.

     T is the threshold for generating  neighborhood  words  from
     the  query sequence prior to scanning the database.  Raising
     the value of T increases the likelihood of completely  miss-
     ing  HSPs,  but  can  decrease  the  search  time and memory
     requirements of the program.  If not explicitly specified, a
     value  suitable for use with the default PAM120 substitution
     matrix will be calculated at run time.

     X is a positive integer representing the maximum permissible
     drop-off  of the cumulative score during word-hit extension.
     Raising X may decrease the chance that the  BLAST  algorithm
     overlooks  an  HSP, but raising X may significantly increase
     the search time, as well.  If computation time is of  little
     concern,  X  might  be  increased a few points.  The default
     value of X is  20,  which  is  intended  to  complement  the
     default PAM120 substitution matrix.

     M is the name of a file containing the substitution  matrix.
     At the present time, only the PAM120 matrix is available.

     For the purpose of calculating significance levels, Y is the
     effective  length  of the query sequence and Z is the effec-
     tive length of the database, both measured in residues.  The
     default  values  for these parameters are the actual lengths
     of the query and database used.

     Pairwise alignments with _E_x_p_e_c_t-_v_a_l_u_e (the  expected  number
     of  alignments with equivalent or greater score) less than N
     are considered significant in their own  right  and,  there-
     fore,  are  not  used  to  form  three-way  alignments.  The
     default  value  for  N  is  0.1.   This  may  be  overridden
     indirectly by specifying a value for U, the highest pairwise
     score to be used to form three-way alignments.

     Three-way alignments with an Expect-value less  than  F  are
     not  reported.  The default value for F is 5.0.  This may be
     overridden indirectly by  specifying  a  value  for  L,  the
     lowest  three-way  alignment score to be reported.  A three-
     way alignment is also not  reported  if  the  _r_a_t_i_o  of  its
     Expect-value  to  the  smallest Expect-value associated with
     any of its component pairwise alignments exceeds  the  value
     of R.  The default value for R is 2.0, but the user may well
     want to use a value of 1.0 or less.

     The command line parameters K and L can be used to set fixed
     values  for  the Karlin statistics' K and lambda parameters,
     respectively.  Users should generally  avoid  setting  these
     parameters  unless  the  full  ramifications of doing so are
     understood.  As an  example  of  one  of  the  less  obvious
     effects  of  manually setting these parameters, the value of
     the H statistic reported at the end of each program's output
     (which  is  distinct  from the command line parameter of the
     same name) is a function of lambda; and  the  default  value
     for  the neighborhood word-score threshold parameter T is in
     turn a function of H.

REGULATING OUTPUT
     By default, blast3 reports  the  pairwise  alignments  found
     during the initial BLAST portion of the search.  Parameter H
     regulates the display of an histogram of the scores  of  the
     highest-scoring  hit  extensions for each database sequence.
     As long as H has a non-zero value,  the  histogram  will  be
     displayed.  The default value for H is 1.

     Parameter V is the maximum number of database _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_s  for
     which  one-line  descriptions will be reported.  The default
     value for V  is  500.   A  warning  message  is  prominently
     displayed at the end of the one-line descriptions section if
     more sequences than V yielded HSPs.   When  V  is  zero,  no
     one-line  descriptions are reported and no warning is given.
     Negative values for V are undefined and disallowed.

     Parameter B regulates the display of the  high-scoring  seg-
     ment pairs.  For positive values, B is the maximum number of
     database _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_s for which high-scoring segment pairs will
     be  reported.   This  may  be  much  smaller than the actual
     number of high-scoring segment  pairs  reported,  since  any
     given  database  sequence may yield several HSPs.  For nega-
     tive values, no limit is imposed on the number of HSPs  that
     will be reported.  The default value for B is 250.  Negative
     values for B are undefined and disallowed.

     If parameter D is made non-zero, the program reports concise
     information  about  all of the pairwise diagonals remembered
     for the three-way search.
