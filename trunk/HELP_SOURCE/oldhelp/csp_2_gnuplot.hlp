OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/SAI/Etc/Export Column statistics to GnuPlot

DESCRIPTION

        - Select a valid column statistic

        - Select what kind of information should be extracted

             Information         Formula
             -------------------------------------
             G+C ratio           (G+C) / N
             G+A ratio           (G+A) / N
             Rate                mutation_sum / frequency_sum
             TT ratio            (min.mutations + transversions) / transversions
             Most freq. base     F1 / N
             2nd freq. base      F2 / N
             3rd freq. base      F3 / N
             Least freq. base    F4 / N
             A ratio             A / N
             C ratio             C / N
             G ratio             G / N
             TU ratio            (T+U) / N
             Helix               boolean (helix or not helix)

             Legend:
             -------
             A/C/G/T/U = amount of A/C/G/T/U's in each column
             N         = total amount of bases in each column
             Fx        = F1 = count of most freq. base, ..., F4 of least freq. base


        - Select if you like smoothing of the values (before they are written to file)

        - Select a filter

        - Select a filename (specify without extension, which will be appended by ARB)

        - Press 'Save' to save to a file or
          Press 'Save & View' to save and start gnuplot

          In the last case you have some more options:

             - Select gnuplot-internal smoothing function

             - Select if to overlay other statistics (which were saved before)

NOTES           Pressing 'Delete all overlayed files' will delete all the files, which would be
                overlayed, if you press 'Save & View'.
