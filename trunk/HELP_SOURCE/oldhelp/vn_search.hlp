TITLE		Search List of Valid Names Manually

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/species/Valid Names/Search manually

DESCRIPTION     Allow the user to select a appropriate valid name from the list
                of available names manually. This is necessary because the automatic suggestion works
                only for 100% identical entries. A preselection from the list of all
                available names can be made by giving any number of initial characters.
                A name selection in the list can then assigned to the current selected species
                and is written to the fields Valid_Names/NameString, description type then is manually.


NOTES		Subspecies are currently not taken into account.
