TITLE		Check and modify the consistency of two alignments

OCCURRENCE	ARB_INTRO/MERGE TWO DATABASES <Check Consistency of Alignments>
		button

DESCRIPTION	Checks the types of data stored within 'alignments' (see 'HELP:
		Glossary') for consistency to prevent merging of non homologous
		data such as 16S and 23S rRNA or protein and DNA sequence data.

		Press the 'Check Consistency of Alignments' button to display
			the 'MERGE ALIGNMENTS' window

		To save modifications pres the 'Save result' button of the
			'ARB_MERGE' window.

NOTES		If any alignment exists only in database I then the alignment
		will be created in database II (but no sequences will be
		copied).

		If the alignment exists in both databases then the sequence_type
		will be compared 

		If any inconsistencies are detected the user has to resolve them
		by pressing the 'MODIFY' button to display the 'ALIGNMENT
		CONTROL' window. This tool allows to modify the alignments.
