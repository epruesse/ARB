TITLE		Transfer one field of selected species

OCCURRENCE	ARB_MERGE/Transfer Species/Transfer Field ...

DESCRIPTION	Copies just one field from all species listed in the source database (DB)
                on the left side, to the corresponding species (i.e. the species with
                same ID aka 'name'-entry) in the target DB on the right side.

		If no such corresponding species exists, it will be created.

		This function has two modes:

		1. Copy mode:
			Overwrite existing fields in target species.

		2. Append mode:
                        Appends to existing fields of target species.
                        To activate the 'Append mode' check 'Append data ???'
                        in the 'TRANSFER FIELD' window.

NOTES		Transferring fields that are not of string type in append mode
		does not work


BUGS		No bugs known
