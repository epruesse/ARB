TITLE		Export Selected Species and Sequences

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/File/Export Foreign Format

DESCRIPTION
		The marked 'species' (see LINK{glossary.hlp}) of the selected
		'alignment' (see LINK{glossary.hlp}) and the corresponding
		sequences are exported in various formats.

		Choose the 'EXPORT FOREIGN FORMAT' option from the 'File' menu
			to display the 'ARB EXPORT' window.

		Select a formate from the corresponding subwindow.

		Define whether the data should be written to one or to multiple
			files by clicking on the checkbox after the 'Should the
			data be written to multiple files:' prompt. In the
			multiple file mode, each 'species' is written to its own
			file.

		Define an output file name by selecting from the 'Directories
			and Files' subwindow or by typing it to the 'Output File
			Name' subwindow. In the multiple file mode, the
			resulting filenames are created by appending the
			'species name' to the specified output filename
			separated by underscores (filename_species name).

		Press the <GO> button


	EXPERT:

		The program reads the selected format
		(formats is $ARBHOME/lib/export/*.eft) and replaces
		all references to species information by the value of
		the reference.
		See LINK{export_format.hlp} for more information.

NOTES		Filters and/or compression not available.

		The formates can be customized (see LINK{export_format.hlp})

EXAMPLES	None

BUGS		No bugs known
