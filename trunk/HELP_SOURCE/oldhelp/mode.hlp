TITLE		NTREE MODES (general info)

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT <buttons in the first column>

DESCRIPTION	Pressing one of the buttons in the left column of the
		'ARB_NT' window activates tree display and modification
		functions.

                You may also use the function keys F1 to F12.
                F1 selects the topmost mode, F2 the next ...

		The middle mouse button (placed anywhere within the tree
		display area) can be used to move the whole tree (works in most modes).

NOTES		A short descriptions of each 'MODE' is shown directly above the
                tree display subwindow. It informs about the differences between the
                left and right mouse key and tells if there are mode-specific keyboard
                shortcuts available.

		To execute the respective functions, the
		cursor has to be located within the tree display area while
		pressing the mouse buttons.

		The scale bar and its label can be moved by positioning the
		cursor anywhere on the bar, keeping the left mouse button
		pressed, moving the cursor to the desired position and
                subsequently releasing the mouse button. The label of the bar
		can be moved independently.

EXAMPLES	None
