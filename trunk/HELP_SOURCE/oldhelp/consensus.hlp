                   'Alignment' subwindow.

		2. Define whether 'marked' (see LINK{glossary.hlp}) or all
                   sequences should be used by pressing the respective
                   checkbox after the 'species' prompt.

                3. See LINK{consensus_def.hlp} for consensus details. 

		4. Define a name for the consensus sequence by selecting one
                   from the 'SAI' subwindow or by typing it to the
                   'Name of New SAI' field.

		entry and automatically edited with 'ARB_EDIT'.
