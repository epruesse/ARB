TITLE		What are Species ?

DESCRIPTION	One species is one database entry containing many database entries
		describing the species and one or more sequences (every sequence
		belongs to a different alignment).

                A species is not necessarily consistent with a taxonomic species.


		[Database field name]		[Comment]

		name				Unique name for a species
						max 8 characters long

		acc				Accession number

		full_name			Name for a species

		strain

		author

		journal

		ali_16s/data			a 16s sequence (part of the 16s alignment)
		ali_23s/data			a 23s sequence
		ali_.../data			a ... sequence

                The description of the alignment, e.g. type or length, is not stored in every
                species but in an alignment description.
