                ARB enhancement:

                    If the 'internal_node_label' contains 'number' it is interpreted as bootstrap value.

                    If the 'internal_node_label' contains 'number:name' number is interpreted as bootstrap value,
                    and name is interpreted as group name.

                    If the 'internal_node_label' contains 'name' it is interpreted as group name.

EXAMPLES	None

WARNINGS	!!! The names associated with terminal nodes have to be
		consistent with those of the current database.!!!

                Never give your groups numeric names or the ARB Newick enhancement will not work for you.
