TITLE		Scan Database for all Fields

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/Species|Genes|Experiments/Info/FIELDS/Show all hidden fields
                ARB_NT/Species|Genes|Experiments/Info/FIELDS/Scan unknown fields
                ARB_NT/Species|Genes|Experiments/Info/FIELDS/Remove unused fields

DESCRIPTION     Each function scans the database to detect all existing fields.

                - 'Show all hidden fields' unhides all currently hidden fields.

                - 'Scan unknown fields' scans the database for fields that are not listed
                  in the field list and adds them to that list.

                - 'Remove unused fields' deletes all fields from the field-list which are
                  not used anywhere in the database.

NOTE		Normally it is not necessary to run 'Scan unknown fields' unless
		some external programs generate new and yet unknown fields
                or if the ARB programmers forgot to announce a field as known.

                In the latter case please write to LINK{devel@arb-home.de} and describe which
                fields was created by doing what.
