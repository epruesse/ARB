TITLE		Node Display Setup (NDS)

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/Tree/NDS
		ARB_GENE_MAP/Properties/NDS

NOTES           Read this text carefully. You won't need this function, but
		it offers many many new possibilities.

DESCRIPTION	Extracts data from the database entries of every species and
		builds a user-readable string from that data.

		This string can be used in many different functions, especially
		to show the species information at the tips of the tree or
		to show gene information at the tips of the genes in the
		gene map.

		It allows you to show part of the sequences, the full_name,
		the accession numbers right in the tree. You may even
		generate tables with all kinds of useful information, like
		probe match results for a set of oligo probes.

		Choose the 'NDS' item from the 'ARB_NT/Tree' menu to
		display the 'NDS' window.

		Enable field extraction:

			Press the corresponding 'SHOW' checkbox to display the
			'field' entry at the nodes of the tree shown in the tree
			display area of the 'ARB_NT' window.


		Select 'FIELD':

			The order of the data shown at the tree nodes
			(from left to right) corresponds to that in the 'NDS'
			window (top to bottom). To select a 'field' enter the field name
			by hand or press the respective <S> button and select it
			from the pop upped list. (Press <RESCAN> to display all
			fields if fields had been deleted from the list
			[ARB_NT/Species/Info/Delete Fields in List])

		Show field entries assigned to internal nodes: (see LINK{glossary.hlp})

			Press the 'INH.' (Inherit) checkbox to display information
			assigned to internal nodes of the tree ('ARB_NT/INFO
			MODE') at all terminal nodes of the subtree defined by
			the internal node. This function only works when using NDS
			with a tree.

		Define number of characters:

			Type the number of characters (including blanks) to be
			displayed to the 'WIDTH' subwindow.

		Display predefined SRT/ACI:

			The 'Search and replace Tool (SRT)' and the 'ARB Command
			Interpreter (ACI)' in combination with 'Nodes Display
			Setup (NDS)' allow information to be extracted and/or modified
			from the 'Field' entries and displayed at the nodes.

			Press the corresponding <SRT> button to display the
                        'SRT_ACI_SELECT' window and select a procedure
                        (see LINK{acisrt.hlp}).
                        The corresponding syntax (see LINK{parser.hlp}
                        and LINK{commands.hlp})
                        is displayed in the 'ACI SRT
                        PROGRAM' subwindow. The displayed strings can be
                        modified by typing to the subwindows.

		Generate new program:

			Type syntax (see LINK{parser.hlp} and
			LINK{commands.hlp}) to the 'ACI SRT
			PROGRAM' subwindow


NOTES		!!! Strings generated using 'SRT' or 'ACI' and displayed at the
		nodes cannot be stored in the database!!!

EXAMPLES	@@@@@ Beispiele !!!!!!

WARNINGS	None

BUGS		The width of the output is limited to 4000 characters.
