TITLE		ARB PARSIMONY INTRO ( Filter Weights )

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT/Tree/Add Species to Tree

DESCRIPTION	Set basic options for the parsimony program. If you do not want
		to use a filter, you should select a filter (eg. E. coli) which excludes only
		the big gaps in the alignment.  Otherwise the program will count
		thousands of uninformative columns.
		If you want a transversion parsimony, open the filter window,
		and change the "simplify" option to TRANSVERSIONS ONLY

NOTES		After pressing go, no species is added, no tree is changed,
		you only get a new window (with some action buttons).	

WARNINGS	You can only change filter settings at startup time.
		You should use filters in combination with large databases
		to speed up computation.
		Gaps ('-') are treated as bases, so check for gaps at
		the beginning or end of short sequences. Replace them by
		'.'.

BUGS		All sequences are read at startup time.  Sequence changes
		afterwards are ignored.  Restart arb_parsimony if you want
		them to take effect.
