TITLE		FORMAT ALIGNMENTS

OCCURRENCE	ARB_NT

DESCRIPTION     Many functions of ARB expect all sequences of an alignent to
                be of the same length (Note: "length" doesn't mean "number
                of bases" here).

                Bringing all sequences to the same length (by adding gaps at
                the end of the sequence) is called "formatting".

                This prompt pops up whenever any alignment is unformatted and
                so provides an easy way to format your sequences.

NOTES		This function is also available in LINK{ad_align.hlp}.

EXAMPLES	None

WARNINGS	None

BUGS		No bugs known
