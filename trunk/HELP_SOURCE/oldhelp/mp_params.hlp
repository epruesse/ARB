TITLE		Multiprobe parameters for calculation

DESCRIPTION     Missing

NOTES           Further parameters the user has to specify:

	        - select how big the combination should be
        	- select if the complement should be checked, too
        	- select the minimum mismatch that unmarked species should have
                  in the combination
        	- for weighting mismatches there are three possiblities:

        		1. all mismatches are weighted equally

        		2. mismatches are weighted depending on which kind of
                           mismatch occured

        		3. mismatches are weighted stronger the nearer it occures
                           at the center of the probe

        	- maximum non-group hits which are allowed for the calculation
        	- last but not least the pt_server has to be chosen. Remember to
                  use an up to date server !!!
