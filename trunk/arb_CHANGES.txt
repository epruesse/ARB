ARB change log

Major changes for next version:

 - CLUSTALW:
   * separated menus for fast and slow alignment
   * most parameters accessible from inside ARB now
 - upgraded to PHYLIP 3.6 (adds PROML)
 - external programs may be called parallel (e.g. several treeing programs)  
 - fixed bugs in protml and integration of protml
 - rewrote ASCII database import
 - arb_repair (script for database repair)
 - fixed bug in data compression
 - increased internal cache size (alignments up to 400.000bp possible)
 - GDE menus cleanup
 - translation/re-alignment tweaked
 - unalign right (EDIT4)
 - visualization of SAIs in Probe Match Results
 - Sequence quality check
 - PT server for genes
 - fixed NEXUS export format
 - import XML tree files

Major changes in Beta 2003_08_22:

 - automatic formatting of alignments
 - SECEDIT may use EDIT4 colors
 - fixed bootstrapping (DNAPARS, PROTPARS, PROTML(experimental!))
 - updated clustalw to version 1.83
 - Restore window sizes for ALL windows (too small sizes are ignored)
 - new algorithm to add partial sequences to an existing tree
 - PROT-parsimony was completely redesigned and works now most similar to DNA/RNA-parsimony
 - Top area of ARB_NTREE may be reduced to maximize display area
 - All arb menus may be detached (click dashed line at top of menu)
 - visualization of SAIs (as background color behind Sequences)
 - ARB_EDIT4 may save/use alignment-specific and alignment-type-specific properties
 - PT-server occupies more memory => does less passes; more diagnostic output
 - small changes to status window (unhide behavior/time estimation)
 - menus and menu-hotkeys reorganized
 - colored buttons in color config windows
 - alignment concatenation (e.g. several different genes)
 - merging data of similar species (according selected database field)
 - keyboard commands for ARB_NTREE (mark/unmark/invert, collapse/expand)
 - expanded sellists
 - save/load fixed for multi probes
 - Binary SAIs are editable in ARB_EDIT4
 - Information windows are detachable (allows to have multiple windows showing different items)
 - Scanning for hidden/unknown database fields improved and seperated;
   possibility to remove unused fields.
 - new tabbed format in 'Export NDS' and 'Export matrix' (useful for star-calc/excel/etc.)
 - updated fastDNAml to 1.2.2
 - added AxML (accelerated fastDNAml 1.2.2)
 - Field transfer definitions for exporting gene-species
 - File Selection: - recursive search available
 - The ARB_NTREE macro recording/execution has been fixed
 - Colorize species (see demo.arb)
 - Fixed missing-character-bug in Xfig, Print and Edit4-Info-Display
 - 'IslandHopper' -- a new integrated aligner (beta)
 - Many improvements and bugfixes to secondary structure editor:
   * highlighting of search (i.e for probes) like in EDIT4
   * interactive constraint editing (stretch/compress)
   * probe info
   * editing secondary structure in XFIG now possible
   * visualization of SAIs
 - import reads Unix, DOS, and MAC linefeeds
 - NTREE/SAI/Etc/GnuPlot: calls gnuplot directly; more plotting features; basic help
 - tree and sequence export to XML ( DTDs are provided in ./lib/dtd )
   (reloading of these XML files is planned for the future)
 - fixed problems with phylip-tree import/export (bootstrap values,comments,...)
 - search in all database fields possible ('[all fields]')
 - up to 10 quicksaves are kept
 - new ACI functions: upper, lower, caps, eval
 - variables for import filter programming
 - extract gene-species: creates acc; extraction to existing alignments
 - sequence of selected gene is mirrored in ARB_EDIT4/local_signature
   (=> selected gene can be highlighted in primary editor)
 - PCR primer-design for single genes
 - when selecting a gene, the corresponding gene-species is selected (if found)
 - save configuration for several windows (e.g. Search&Query, WWW, NDS, ...)
 - file selection box in import window
 - mark item with double click works in all search&query windows
 - User masks: create new; 'edit enable' and 'marked' toggles (like in info window)
 - Fixed command line help for all Arb-modules
 - Fixed problem parsing fonts (should fix display problems with default fonts)
 - Mark mode now works in list-view as well (ARB_NTREE)
 - Fixed appearance of 'tiny little boxes' (everywhere)
 - Redesign of ARB help:
     - a HTML version is in $ARBHOME/lib/help_html
     - a text version is in $ARBHOME/lib/help (like before, but now generated)

Major changes in Beta 2001_11_07:

 - design probes to maximum length of 60 nucleotides
 - fastAligner1.03 bug fixed (chooses best match now in 'auto search' mode)
 - import default changed to foreign data format, ali name '16s'
 - printing of multi-page-trees works again
 - implemented user defineable masks to access database fields
 - fixed bugs in pt-server (lockup, unknown species just after building pt-server)
 - improved performance during pt-server-build
 - several programs coming along with ARB where updated (PHYLIP,...)
 - reads EMBL genom files
 - support for experiments (genom databases only)

Major changes in Beta 2001_07_24:

 - basic support for genoms (Gene Map, reads Genebank files)
 - ported to libc6
