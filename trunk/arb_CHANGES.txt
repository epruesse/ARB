 - up to 10 quicksaves may exist at the same time
 - new ACI functions: upper, lower, caps
 - variables for import filter programming
 - extract gene-species: creates acc; extraction to existing alignments
 - sequence of selected gene is mirrored in ARB_EDIT4/local_signature
   (=> selected gene can be highlighted in primary editor)
 - PCR primer-design for single genes
 - when selecting a gene, the corresponding gene-species is selected (if found)
 - save configuration for several windows (i.e. Search&Query, WWW, NDS, ...)
 - highlight search occurances in ARB_SECEDIT
 - file selection box in import window
 - mark item with double click works in all search&query windows
