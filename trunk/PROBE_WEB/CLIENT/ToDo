ToDo for arb_probe_library CLIENT:
==================================

- list of probes:
        ** restrict to probes in specified temperature- and/or gccontent-range

- list of selected probes:
        ** 'Add' button to add current selected probe from normal probe list
        ** 'Del' button
        ** 'Match all' -> mark species hit by ANY probe 

- tree display:
        ** show group names left of unfolded branch?
        ** autofold if tree height > 32000

- details:
        ** missing information:
        *** probe length
        *** % of subtree (and total # of species in subtree)

- Don't send request, if result is known to be empty
        (e.g. if node has no probes etc.)
