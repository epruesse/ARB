ToDo for arb_probe_library CLIENT:
==================================

- list of probes:
        ** restrict to probes in specified temperature- and/or gccontent-range
        ** should define minimum height (curr. it disappears sometimes)
        ** autoscroll to selection
        ** Bug in Overlap:
                overlap seq = ACCCA
                seq = CCC
                => CCC is not striped-out
                * WICHTIG!

- list of selected probes:
        ** 'Add' button to add current selected probe from normal probe list
        ** 'Del' button
        ** 'Match all' -> mark species hit by ANY probe

- tree display:
        ** show group names left of unfolded branch?
        ** calculate text-length for ALL nodes (as attribute of node)
                *** use in calc. of tree-width
                *** use to size group-boxes

- details:
        ** missing information:
                *** probe length

- Don't send request, if result is known to be empty
        (e.g. if node has no probes etc.)
