Programs in GDE subfolders are not related to GDE.

Only the method how they are called is similar to the
method introduced by GDE. That method uses a scriptable
menu configuration, defining parameters and how to pass them
to the single programs.

These menus can be configured
        in                       ../GDEHELP/ARB_GDEmenus.source
        and in .menu files in    ../GDEHELP/MENUS

The 'GDE menus language' is decribed in
        ../HELP_SOURCE/oldhelp/gde_menus.hlp
