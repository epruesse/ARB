 *  \brief  Adds support for protein structure prediction, comparison of two
 *          protein secondary structures and of amino acid sequences with protein
 *          secondary structures as well as visualization of the match quality in EDIT4.
 *  \author Markus Urban
 *  \date   2008-02-08
 *
 *  This file contains functions that predict a protein secondary structure from
 *  its primary structure (i.e. the amino acid sequence) and for visualizing
 *  how good a sequence matches a given secondary structure. Two secondary
 *  structures can be compared, too. The initial values for the match symbols
 *  and other settings are defined here, as well as functions that create a 
 *  "Protein Match Settings" window allowing the user to change the default
 *  properties for match computation.
 * 
 *  \sa The functions for protein structure prediction are based on a statistical
 *      method known as Chou-Fasman algorithm. For details refer to "Chou, P. and
 *      Fasman, G. (1978). Prediction of the secondary structure of proteins from
 *      their amino acid sequence. Advanced Enzymology, 47, 45-148.".
 * 
 *  \attention The used method for secondary structure prediciton is fast which
 *             was the main reason for choosing it. Performance is important
 *             for a large number of sequences loaded in the editor. However, it
 *             is not very accurate and should only be used as rough estimation.
 *             For our purpose, the algorithm as well as own adaptions to it are 
 *             used to get an approximate overview if a given amino acid sequence 
 *             does not match a certain secondary structure.

 *  This function compares a protein secondary structure with a primary structure
 *  (= amino acid sequence) or another secondary structure depending on \a match_method.
 * 
 *  \par Match method SECSTRUCT_SECSTRUCT:
 *       Two secondary structures are compared one by one using the criteria defined 
 *       by #pfold_pairs. The match symbols are taken from #pfold_pair_chars.
 * 
 *  \par Match method SECSTRUCT_SEQUENCE:
 *       An amino acid sequence is compared with a secondary structure by taking
 *       cohesive parts of the structure - gaps in the alignment are skipped - and
 *       computing the normalized difference of former and breaker values for this
 *       region in the given sequence such that a value from 0 - 100% for the
 *       match quality is generated. By dividing this value into steps of 10%
 *       it is mapped to the match symbols defined by #PFOLD_PAIR_CHARS_2. Note
 *       that bends ('S') are assumed to fit everywhere (=> best match symbol), and
 *       if a structure is encountered but no corresponding amino acid the worst match 
 *       symbol is chosen.
 * 
 *  \par Match method SECSTRUCT_SEQUENCE_PREDICT:
 *       An amino acid sequence is compared with a secondary structure using a full
 *       prediction of the secondary structure from its sequence via
 *       ED4_pfold_predict_structure() and comparing it one by one with the reference
 *       structure. Note that not the structure summary is used for comparison, but
 *       the individual predicted structure types as returned in \a structures[4].
 *       The match criteria are defined in #pfold_pairs which is searched in ascending
 *       order, i.e. good matches first, then the worse ones. If a match is found
 *       the corresponding match symbol (as defined by #pfold_pair_chars) is chosen.
 *       Note that if a structure is encountered but no corresponding amino acid the
 *       worst match symbol is chosen.
 * 
 *  The match criteria (for #SECSTRUCT_SECSTRUCT and #SECSTRUCT_SEQUENCE_PREDICT) as
 *  well as the match symbols (for all methods) can be adjusted by the user in the
 *  "Protein Match Settings" dialog. The result of the match computation (i.e. the
 *  match symbols) is written to the result buffer.
